## TEACHING TIPS

### Differentiation:

- For struggling learners: Focus on the most common types of fraud they might encounter and provide simple checklists for identifying warning signs.
- For advanced learners: Challenge them to research emerging fraud trends and present their findings to the class.

### Engagement Strategies:

- Use current, relevant examples that students can relate to.
- Incorporate brief video clips of real scam attempts when discussing each type of fraud.
- Create a safe environment where students feel comfortable sharing personal experiences with scams.

### Assessment:

- Informal assessment through group discussions and scenario analysis.
- Written reflections from the Skill Builder activity.
- Participation in class discussions and strategy development.

### Common Misconceptions to Address:

- "I'm too tech-savvy to fall for scams." Even technology experts can be victimized by sophisticated scammers.
- "Only older people fall for fraud." Fraud affects all age groups, with certain scams specifically targeting younger individuals.
- "If I realize I've been scammed, it's too late to do anything." Emphasize the importance of immediate reporting.
