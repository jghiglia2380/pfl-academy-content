## SKILL BUILDER: RECOGNIZING A PHISHING SCAM

**Introduction:** In this activity, you'll explore a common online scam scenario—phishing—and learn how to recognize the warning signs. Scammers often use messages that seem too good to be true, like offering free trips or gifts, to get personal information or money from people. It's important to know how to spot these scams and protect yourself and others.

**Activity Overview:** You'll be watching a short video featuring two friends discussing a suspicious email that one of them received. After the video, you'll be asked to reflect on how you can apply what you've learned to real-life situations. Think about how you would explain these scams to someone who might not know the warning signs, and what strategies you would use to keep the conversation positive and helpful.

**Instructions:**

1. Watch the Video: Pay close attention to the dialogue between Sarah and her friend. Notice the specific tips and strategies that the friend uses to help Sarah understand why the email might be a scam.
2. Reflect and Write: After watching the video, take a few minutes to think about how you could share this information with someone in your own life.

**Reflection Prompt:**
Think about a time when you or someone you know received a suspicious message or email. How did you or they respond? How would you approach a family member or friend who might not be as aware of these types of scams? Write a few sentences explaining how you would educate them to stay safe online, without making them feel embarrassed or defensive. What would be your strategy to keep the conversation supportive and helpful?

- If something seems too good to be true, it probably is
