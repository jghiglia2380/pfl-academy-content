      "main_content": "Understanding the distinction between jobs and careers helps you make informed decisions about your financial future. Jobs typically provide immediate income to meet current needs, while careers involve long-term planning and often require specific education or training. Jobs may have limited advancement opportunities and rarely require specialized education beyond high school or basic certifications. Careers, on the other hand, usually offer a progression of increasingly responsible positions and often necessitate specific degrees, certifications, or ongoing professional development.\n\nYour skills, knowledge, and experience form your \"human capital\" - an asset that increases in value over time with strategic investments. Both jobs and careers can build your human capital, but in different ways:\n\nThrough Jobs:\n• Developing interpersonal communication skills\n• Learning time management and reliability\n• Building customer service experience\n• Understanding workplace expectations\n\nThrough Careers:\n• Acquiring specialized technical skills\n• Building professional networks\n• Developing industry expertise\n• Gaining leadership experience",
      "implications": "Your choice between pursuing jobs or developing a career significantly impacts your earning potential over time. The job vs. career distinction has significant financial consequences:\n\nJob-Focused Approach:\n• Provides immediate income\n• May limit future earning potential\n• Offers less financial stability long-term\n• Typically has limited benefits (healthcare, retirement)\n\nCareer-Focused Approach:\n• May require initial investment (education/training)\n• Offers higher long-term earning potential\n• Provides greater financial stability\n• Often includes comprehensive benefits"

Careers offer long-term financial benefits and growth but require intentional planning and investment in your human capital. The choices you make now about education, skill development, and work experience will significantly impact your financial future.",
    "reflection_prompt": "Think about your current or future work opportunities:\n• What skills could you develop that would transfer to your long-term goals?\n• How might your approach to a part-time job change if you viewed it through a career development lens?\n• What additional training or education might help you bridge the gap between jobs and a career path?",
