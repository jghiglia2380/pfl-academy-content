# Understanding and Managing Risk Learning Lab

## Overview

Welcome to the Risk Management Learning Lab! Today, you'll apply what you learned about risk through hands-on activities that simulate real-world decisions. You'll evaluate different risk scenarios, analyze insurance options, assess your personal risk tolerance, and develop a comprehensive risk management plan for your financial future.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this learning lab, you will be able to:
- Evaluate risk scenarios and select appropriate management strategies
- Compare insurance options and determine appropriate coverage levels for different situations
- Assess your personal risk tolerance through interactive scenarios
- Develop a personalized risk management plan that aligns with your goals
- Apply cost-benefit analysis to risk management decisions

## Warm-Up: Risk Perception Exercise

Take a few minutes to consider the following risks. For each one, rate how likely you think it is to happen and how severe the consequences would be if it did occur. Use a scale of 1-5, where 1 is very low and 5 is very high.

| Risk Event | Likelihood (1-5) | Severity (1-5) | Your Rating (L × S) |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Car accident |  |  |  |
| Smartphone theft |  |  |  |
| House fire |  |  |  |
| Job loss |  |  |  |
| Medical emergency |  |  |  |

Once you've completed your ratings, calculate the Risk Rating by multiplying Likelihood × Severity.

**Discussion Questions:**
- Which risks received your highest ratings, and why?
- How do your ratings compare with your classmates'?
- What factors influence how we perceive the likelihood and severity of different risks?
- How might our perception of risk differ from the actual statistical risk?

## Activity 1: Risk Management Case Studies

In this activity, you'll analyze four detailed risk scenarios and develop comprehensive risk management plans for each situation.

### Instructions:

1. Form small groups of 3-4 students
2. Read each case study carefully
3. Discuss and decide which risk management strategies would be most appropriate
4. For each case, develop a complete plan that might include multiple strategies
5. Be prepared to share your group's recommendations with the class

### Case Study 1: The New Driver

**Scenario:** Jordan just got their driver's license at age 16 and will be sharing the family's second car—a 10-year-old sedan valued at $8,000. Jordan's parents are concerned about the increased risk of accidents with a new driver and the potential financial impact.

**Considerations:**
- The family has basic liability insurance on the vehicle
- Jordan will be driving to school (5 miles) and to part-time work (3 miles)
- The family has $5,000 in emergency savings
- Adding Jordan to the insurance policy will increase premiums significantly
- Jordan has saved $1,000 from summer work

**Your Task:** Develop a comprehensive risk management plan for Jordan and their family.

### Case Study 2: The Small Business Owner

**Scenario:** Alex has operated a small bakery for two years. The business has $50,000 in equipment, employs three part-time workers, and has just begun to be profitable. Alex rents the commercial space and lives in an apartment nearby.

**Considerations:**
- Alex has invested most of their savings in the business
- The bakery is located in an area that occasionally experiences flooding
- Food businesses face potential liability from customer illness
- Equipment breakdown could halt operations
- Alex has no employees with specialized skills who could temporarily run the business

**Your Task:** Develop a comprehensive risk management plan for Alex's bakery business.

### Case Study 3: The Digital Nomad

**Scenario:** Taylor works remotely as a freelance graphic designer while traveling internationally. Taylor owns a high-end laptop ($2,500), camera equipment ($3,000), and smartphone ($1,000) that are essential for their work. Taylor stays in short-term rentals and changes locations every 1-3 months.

**Considerations:**
- Taylor's income depends entirely on having functional equipment
- Travel increases the risk of theft, damage, or loss
- Different countries have varying levels of healthcare access and costs
- Taylor's belongings are rarely in one secure location for long periods
- Taylor maintains a $10,000 emergency fund

### Case Study 4: The Young Family

**Scenario:** Cam and Riley, both 28, recently had their first child. They have a mortgage on a house valued at $300,000 with $250,000 remaining on the loan. Cam earns $60,000 annually while Riley has temporarily reduced work hours to care for their child, earning $25,000 part-time.

**Considerations:**
- They have $15,000 in emergency savings
- Both have employer-provided health insurance
- Their retirement accounts total $40,000
- They live in an area with occasional severe storms
- Their extended family lives several states away

**Your Task:** Develop a comprehensive risk management plan for Cam and Riley's family situation.

- How would your recommendation change if your savings were $10,000 instead of $2,000?

### Scenario 2: Renter's Insurance Evaluation

**Situation:** You're renting your first apartment and need to decide on renter's insurance. Your belongings are worth approximately $8,000, including a $1,500 laptop, $800 smartphone, and various furniture, clothing, and personal items.

## Activity 4: Personal Risk Management Plan

In this activity, you'll develop a comprehensive personal risk management plan that identifies potential risks and outlines appropriate strategies for addressing them.

### Instructions:

1. Identify the top risks you face across different categories
2. Evaluate each risk based on likelihood and potential impact
3. Determine the most appropriate risk management strategy for each
4. Create an action plan with specific steps to implement each strategy

### Risk Identification Worksheet:
