## Learning Lab Plan Breakdown

### Welcome and Warm-Up: Risk Perception Exercise (7 minutes)

- Begin by having students complete the risk perception table, rating the likelihood and severity of different risk events
- Guide students to calculate risk ratings by multiplying likelihood × severity
- Facilitate a brief discussion about how personal experiences and biases affect risk perception
- Highlight how risk perceptions often differ from statistical realities
- Connect this activity to the importance of objective risk assessment in financial decision-making

**Teaching Tip**: Create a quick visual representation of the class's aggregate risk ratings on the board. This helps students see how risk perception varies among their peers and can spark discussion about why these differences exist.

### Activity 1: Risk Management Case Studies (12 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups of 3-4
- Assign each group one or more case studies to analyze (or allow groups to choose)
- Explain that groups should:
  - Identify all significant risks in their case study
  - Consider appropriate management strategies for each risk
  - Develop a comprehensive plan that addresses all major concerns
  - Justify their recommendations with specific reasoning

- Circulate among groups to provide guidance and prompt deeper analysis
- Ensure groups consider multiple risk management strategies rather than relying solely on insurance
- Have each group briefly present their case and recommendations (1-2 minutes per group)
- Highlight effective approaches and suggest additional considerations where appropriate

**Teaching Tip**: Encourage students to think holistically about risk management. For each case study, prompt them to consider at least one strategy from each of the four approaches (avoidance, reduction, acceptance, transfer) rather than defaulting to the most obvious solution.

### Activity 2: Insurance Coverage Analyzer (12 minutes)

- Introduce the Insurance Coverage Analyzer activity as a practical application of risk transfer strategy
- Explain that insurance decisions involve balancing protection against cost
- Review key insurance terminology that appears in the scenarios (liability, deductible, premium, etc.)
- Have students work individually or in pairs to analyze the auto and renter's insurance scenarios
- Guide students to consider:
  - The financial impact of different coverage choices
  - How personal financial circumstances affect appropriate coverage levels
  - The trade-off between premium costs and deductible amounts
  - How to prioritize coverage for the most significant risks

- Facilitate a class discussion about the recommendations for each scenario
- Highlight how different personal situations might lead to different optimal choices
- Discuss how insurance needs change throughout different life stages

**Teaching Tip**: Use a concrete example to demonstrate the financial implications of being underinsured. For instance, show the out-of-pocket costs if someone with minimum coverage has an at-fault accident causing $100,000 in damages or if a renter with no insurance loses everything in an apartment fire.

### Activity 3: Risk Tolerance Assessment (10 minutes)

- Introduce the concept of risk tolerance as a personal characteristic that affects financial decisions
- Guide students through the risk tolerance assessment scenarios
- Explain the scoring system and how to interpret results
- Have students calculate their personal risk tolerance scores
- Facilitate a discussion about how risk tolerance influences financial decision-making:
  - Investment choices
  - Insurance coverage decisions
  - Career and education paths
  - Emergency fund size
  - General financial planning

- Emphasize that there is no "correct" level of risk tolerance—what matters is making decisions that align with personal comfort levels while still pursuing goals
- Discuss how risk tolerance might change with age, financial stability, and life circumstances

**Teaching Tip**: Create a "risk tolerance spectrum" on the board and have students place sticky notes or markers showing where they fall. This visual representation helps illustrate the diversity of risk preferences and can lead to productive discussions about different approaches to financial decisions.

### Activity 4: Personal Risk Management Plan (12 minutes)

- Introduce the Personal Risk Management Plan as a practical tool students can use in their own lives
- Walk through the risk identification worksheet, explaining each component:
  - Risk categories and specific risks
  - Rating likelihood and impact
  - Calculating risk ratings
  - Selecting management strategies
  - Creating action steps

- Demonstrate how to complete the worksheet with a sample risk
- Have students work individually to identify and analyze their personal risks
- Guide students to create specific, actionable implementation timelines
- Encourage realistic action steps that they can actually accomplish
- Circulate to provide individual guidance and suggestions

**Teaching Tip**: For students who may be uncomfortable sharing personal risks, provide a "persona" option—they can complete the exercise for a fictional young adult with typical risks. This allows practice with the methodology while maintaining privacy.

### Portfolio Project Introduction (5 minutes)

- Introduce the Risk Management Case Analysis portfolio project
- Review the project requirements and expectations:
  - Topic selection
  - Research components
  - Analysis elements
  - Visual requirements
  - Conclusion and recommendations

- Discuss resources for researching risk management topics
- Show examples of appropriate visual components (risk matrices, decision trees, etc.)
- Address any questions about project parameters
- Explain the due date and submission process

**Teaching Tip**: Suggest that students connect their portfolio project to personal interests or career aspirations to increase engagement. For example, a student interested in healthcare could focus on health-related risks, while a technology enthusiast might explore cybersecurity risks.

### Reflection and Wrap-Up (5 minutes)

- Guide students through the final reflection questions:
  - Most valuable insights gained
  - Evolution of understanding about risk management
  - Most personally useful risk management strategies
  - Specific implementation steps

- Have students share one key takeaway or planned action step
- Summarize the main concepts from both Day 1 and the Learning Lab
- Emphasize the practical application of risk management in everyday life
- Preview upcoming topics related to risk management and insurance

**Teaching Tip**: Create a "One Thing I'll Do" board where students can post one specific risk management action they plan to take in the next week. This promotes accountability and helps connect classroom learning to real-life application.
