## Learning Lab Plan Breakdown

### Welcome and Warm-Up: Insurance Myths and Facts (7 minutes)

- Begin by having students identify which statements are myths and which are facts from the provided list
- After a few minutes of individual work, facilitate a brief discussion about common insurance misconceptions
- Reveal the correct answers:
  - Myth: Young adults don't need life insurance (some might, depending on dependents, debt, etc.)
  - Myth: Red cars cost more to insure (color doesn't affect premiums)
  - Fact: Credit scores can affect insurance premiums
  - Myth: Insurance always pays off auto loans (gap insurance is needed if loan exceeds value)
  - Myth: Landlord's policy covers renters' belongings (renters need their own insurance)
  - Myth: Health insurance always covers 100% after deductible (co-insurance often applies)
  - Myth: Insurance companies can cancel anytime (regulations restrict cancellations)
  - Myth: Minimum liability is sufficient (often inadequate for serious accidents)

- Discuss why these misconceptions persist and their potential financial consequences

**Teaching Tip**: Create a quick visual "myth-busting" display by having students place green checkmarks next to facts and red X's next to myths on a classroom display. This interactive approach engages students visually and kinesthetically.

### Activity 1: Policy Comparison Analysis (12 minutes)

- Introduce the policy comparison activity by explaining that insurance policies differ significantly in their features, costs, and benefits
- Review the health insurance policies in Scenario 1, clarifying any confusing terminology:
  - Explain the trade-off between premium costs and deductibles
  - Define network types (PPO vs. HMO)
  - Clarify how co-insurance and out-of-pocket maximums work

- Guide students through comparing the auto insurance policies in Scenario 2:
  - Emphasize the significance of liability limits
  - Explain how deductibles apply to collision and comprehensive coverage
  - Highlight the importance of optional coverages for different situations

- Have students work in pairs or small groups to complete the comparison worksheets
- Circulate to provide guidance and answer questions
- Facilitate a brief discussion about the recommendations, emphasizing that the "best" policy depends on individual circumstances, risk tolerance, and financial situation

**Teaching Tip**: Use concrete examples to illustrate the financial impact of these policies. For example, "If you cause an accident with $200,000 in medical bills and have only $50,000 in liability coverage, you'd be personally responsible for the remaining $150,000."

### Activity 2: Insurance Needs Throughout Life Stages (12 minutes)

- Introduce the life stage analysis activity, emphasizing how insurance needs evolve throughout life
- Review the three life stage profiles:
  - Recent College Graduate (Taylor)
  - Young Family (Jordan and Alex)
  - Pre-Retirement (Pat)

- Divide students into three groups, assigning each group one life stage
- Guide groups to:
  - Identify key risks specific to their assigned life stage
  - Recommend appropriate insurance types and coverage levels
  - Prioritize insurance needs based on the individual's circumstances
  - Explain their reasoning

- Have each group briefly present their recommendations (2 minutes per group)
- Highlight how insurance priorities shift across life stages:
  - Young adults: Health, auto, renters, possibly disability
  - Families: Life, comprehensive health, higher liability limits
  - Pre-retirement: Long-term care considerations, adjusting life insurance

**Teaching Tip**: Create a visual "insurance lifecycle" on the board showing how different insurance types become more or less important at different life stages. This helps students see insurance as an evolving part of financial planning rather than a static decision.

### Activity 3: Insurance Cost-Benefit Analysis (12 minutes)

- Introduce the cost-benefit analysis activity, emphasizing the importance of evaluating both the costs and potential benefits of insurance options
- Walk through the methodology for Scenario 1 (Homeowner's Insurance Deductible):
  - Demonstrate how to calculate the 5-year cost for each option
  - Show how the calculation changes based on claim frequency
  - Explain that the lowest premium isn't always the most cost-effective option

- Guide students through Scenario 2 (Term Life Insurance):
  - Demonstrate how to calculate the total premium cost over the full term
  - Discuss how to evaluate the protection provided at different life stages
  - Explain the concept of "insurance value" beyond just the dollar amount

- Have students work individually or in pairs to complete the calculations and analysis
- Review the results as a class, emphasizing that cost-benefit analysis is a critical tool for making insurance decisions
- Discuss non-financial factors that might influence these decisions, such as risk tolerance and peace of mind

**Teaching Tip**: Use a visual aid like a decision matrix to help students organize their cost-benefit analysis. This systematic approach helps students see that insurance decisions involve multiple factors beyond just the premium cost.

### Activity 4: Insurance Strategy Development (12 minutes)

- Introduce the Rodriguez family profile, emphasizing the complexity of developing a comprehensive insurance strategy for a family with multiple needs and constraints
- Guide students to approach the strategy development systematically:
  - First, identify protection gaps and critical risks
  - Next, prioritize needs based on potential financial impact
  - Then, develop specific recommendations with coverage levels
  - Finally, create an implementation plan that addresses the most critical needs first

- Have students work in small groups to develop their strategies
- Circulate to provide guidance and prompt deeper analysis
- Have groups share their top three recommendations and implementation priorities
- Highlight effective approaches and suggest additional considerations

**Teaching Tip**: Encourage students to think holistically about the family's situation rather than addressing each insurance type in isolation. For example, "If Carlos is unable to work due to illness, how would that affect the family's income, health insurance, and ability to pay the mortgage?"

### Portfolio Project Introduction (5 minutes)

- Introduce the Comprehensive Insurance Plan portfolio project
- Walk through the project requirements and expectations:
  - Personal risk profile assessment
  - Risk identification and prioritization
  - Specific insurance recommendations
  - Implementation timeline
  - Budget allocation

- Explain that students can base their plan on their current circumstances or projected future situation
- Emphasize the importance of research and realistic premium estimates
- Address any questions about project parameters
- Explain the due date and submission process

**Teaching Tip**: Provide a sample portfolio project outline to help students visualize the final product. This concrete example sets clear expectations and helps students understand the scope of the project.

### Reflection and Wrap-Up (5 minutes)

- Guide students through the final reflection questions:
  - How has their understanding of insurance changed?
  - Which aspects of insurance selection do they feel most confident about?
  - What factors will be most important in their future insurance decisions?
  - How will they balance premium costs with the need for adequate protection?

- Have students share one key takeaway or insight
- Summarize the main concepts from both Day 1 and the Learning Lab
- Emphasize that insurance is an ongoing part of financial planning that requires regular review and adjustment
- Preview upcoming topics related to risk management and financial security

**Teaching Tip**: Create a "One Thing I Learned" exit ticket where students write down the most valuable insight they gained about insurance. Collect these to assess understanding and identify any remaining misconceptions to address in future lessons.
