## Learning Lab Plan Breakdown

### Welcome and Warm-Up: Insurance Cost Calculation Challenge (7 minutes)

- Begin by having students complete the insurance cost calculation challenge
- Guide them through calculating:
  - Annual premium cost: $250 × 12 = $3,000
  - Co-pay costs: (4 × $30) + (2 × $60) = $120 + $120 = $240
  - Deductible payment: $1,500
  - Co-insurance payment: ($10,000 - $1,500) × 0.20 = $8,500 × 0.20 = $1,700
  - Total out-of-pocket costs: $3,000 + $240 + $1,500 + $1,700 = $6,440

- Facilitate a brief discussion about:
  - Which cost component had the largest impact (premiums)
  - How costs would change with minimal usage (primarily just premium costs)
  - How costs would change with catastrophic expenses (reaching the out-of-pocket maximum)

**Teaching Tip**: Use a visual breakdown of these costs on the board to help students see how each component contributes to the total. Create a pie chart showing the proportion of each cost type to emphasize their relative impact.

### Activity 1: Comprehensive Insurance Plan Comparison (15 minutes)

- Introduce the insurance plan comparison activity, emphasizing the importance of analyzing total costs rather than just premium differences
- Review the health insurance scenario first:
  - Explain the three plan options (Low Deductible, Medium Deductible, HDHP)
  - Walk through how to calculate costs for each usage scenario
  - Demonstrate the calculation process for one example scenario

- Guide students to work in pairs to complete the calculations for all usage scenarios:
  - For minimal usage, emphasize how premiums dominate when little care is needed
  - For moderate usage, show how deductibles and co-insurance start to factor in
  - For heavy usage, highlight the importance of out-of-pocket maximums

- Review the auto insurance scenario:
  - Explain the three policy options (Basic, Enhanced, Premium)
  - Discuss the trade-offs between premiums and deductibles
  - Emphasize the importance of adequate liability coverage

- Have students calculate total costs for the three auto insurance scenarios
- Facilitate a discussion about which plans provide the best value in different situations
- Highlight how personal financial circumstances (emergency savings, assets) affect the optimal choice

**Teaching Tip**: Create a decision matrix template that students can use to systematically compare plans across multiple dimensions. This visual tool helps organize the various factors that influence insurance decisions.

### Activity 2: Cost-Saving Strategy Evaluation (12 minutes)

- Introduce the cost-saving strategy evaluation activity
- Review the five major strategies:
  1. Increasing Deductibles
  2. Using Health Savings Accounts
  3. Bundling Multiple Policies
  4. Raising Credit Score
  5. Utilizing Employer Benefits

- For each strategy, discuss:
  - Potential savings percentage
  - Advantages and disadvantages
  - Appropriate circumstances for implementation
  - Potential risks and mitigations

- Divide students into three groups, assigning each group one persona:
  - Recent Graduate
  - Mid-Career Professional
  - Pre-Retirement Parent

- Have each group evaluate which 2-3 strategies would be most beneficial for their assigned persona and why
- Have groups share their recommendations, emphasizing how different life stages and financial situations lead to different optimal strategies
- Facilitate a discussion about prioritizing strategies when resources are limited

**Teaching Tip**: Create "Persona Cards" with detailed financial information and circumstances for each profile. This concrete representation helps students connect the strategies to specific situations rather than abstract concepts.

### Activity 3: Insurance Decision Framework Development (12 minutes)

- Introduce the framework development activity, explaining that a systematic approach to insurance decisions leads to better outcomes
- Review the five key steps in the decision process:
  1. Needs Assessment
  2. Plan Comparison
  3. Scenario Analysis
  4. Non-Financial Considerations
  5. Decision and Implementation

- For each step, discuss:
  - Key questions to address
  - Information needed
  - Evaluation criteria
  - Common pitfalls

- Guide students to create their own decision frameworks individually or in pairs
- Provide a template structure that they can customize
- Encourage creativity in developing evaluation criteria and weighting systems
- Have students test their frameworks using one of the scenarios from Activity 1
- Ask 2-3 students to share their frameworks and how they lead to decisions

**Teaching Tip**: Provide examples of different decision frameworks, such as weighted scoring systems, decision trees, or flowcharts. This exposure to multiple approaches helps students understand that there's no single "right" way to make insurance decisions.

### Activity 4: Insurance Cost Management Plan (10 minutes)

- Introduce the insurance cost management plan activity as a personal application of the concepts
- Review the five components of the plan:
  1. Current/Anticipated Insurance Needs
  2. Cost-Saving Opportunities
  3. Comprehensive Strategy
  4. Implementation Timeline
  5. Evaluation Metrics

- For each component, provide guidance on:
  - Key elements to include
  - Considerations specific to different life stages
  - Practical implementation steps
  - Resources for further information

- Have students work individually to develop their personal plans
- Encourage them to be realistic about their current or anticipated situations
- Remind students that they may use one of the personas if they prefer not to use their personal circumstances
- Circulate to provide individual guidance and answer questions
- Have 1-2 volunteers share highlights from their plans

**Teaching Tip**: Create a sample insurance cost management plan based on a fictional persona to serve as a model. This concrete example helps students understand the level of detail and comprehensive thinking expected in their own plans.

### Portfolio Project Introduction (5 minutes)

- Introduce the Insurance Cost Analysis and Optimization portfolio project
- Review the project requirements and components:
  1. Research Summary
  2. Cost Analysis
  3. Optimization Strategy
  4. Decision-Making Tool

- Discuss potential insurance types to focus on and their unique considerations:
  - Health insurance: Complex cost structures, significant potential expenses
  - Auto insurance: Required by law, multiple coverage components
  - Homeowner's/Renter's insurance: Property and liability protection
  - Life insurance: Long-term commitment, different product types

- Provide guidance on resources for research:
  - Insurance company websites
  - Consumer protection organizations
  - Financial education websites
  - Government resources

- Address questions about project expectations and timeline
- Show examples of high-quality components if available

**Teaching Tip**: Create a project planning guide with suggested milestones and checkpoints to help students manage this complex assignment. Breaking the project into manageable steps makes it less overwhelming.

### Reflection and Wrap-Up (5 minutes)

- Guide students through the final reflection questions:
  - How their understanding of insurance costs has evolved
  - Which cost management strategies they find most valuable
  - What surprised them about the relationship between premiums and other costs
  - How they'll apply this knowledge to future decisions

- Ask 2-3 students to share one key insight from the learning lab
- Summarize the main concepts from both Day 1 and the Learning Lab:
  - Insurance involves balancing predictable premiums with potential out-of-pocket costs
  - The "best" insurance plan depends on individual circumstances and expected usage
  - Strategic decisions about deductibles, coverage levels, and policy features can provide significant savings
  - Regular review and adjustment of insurance coverage is necessary as circumstances change

- Preview upcoming topics related to insurance and financial protection

**Teaching Tip**: Create an "Insurance Decision Checklist" as a takeaway resource that students can refer to when making future insurance decisions. This practical tool extends the learning beyond the classroom.
