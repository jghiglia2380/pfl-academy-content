# 14.1: Charitable Giving and Financial Planning - Learning Lab

## Overview

In this Learning Lab, you'll apply what you've learned about charitable giving through interactive activities designed to help you explore different ways to give back, integrate charitable giving into financial planning, and understand the impact of your contributions. Through hands-on exercises, group discussions, and real-world applications, you'll develop practical skills for making meaningful contributions to causes you care about.

## Warm-Up: Charitable Giving Reflection

Take a few minutes to reflect on the following questions and share your thoughts with a partner:

1. What causes or issues do you feel most passionate about? Why?
2. Have you or your family ever donated time, money, or goods to a charitable organization? What was that experience like?
3. If you could solve one problem in your community, what would it be and why?

## Activity 1: Charitable Organization Research Project

In this activity, you'll research charitable organizations that align with your interests and values.

### Instructions:

1. Choose a cause or issue you care about (e.g., education, environment, homelessness, animal welfare).

2. Research 2-3 charitable organizations that address this cause. Use reputable charity evaluation websites such as:
   - Charity Navigator
   - GuideStar
   - CharityWatch
   - BBB Wise Giving Alliance

3. For each organization, gather the following information:
   - Mission and programs
   - How donations are used (percentage to programs vs. administrative costs)
   - Ways to contribute (monetary, volunteering, in-kind)
   - Evidence of impact and effectiveness
   - Financial health and transparency

4. Create a brief comparison of the organizations, highlighting their strengths and any concerns.

5. Select the organization you would most likely support and explain your reasoning.

> **Discussion Prompt**: What criteria did you use to evaluate charitable organizations? How important is financial efficiency (low administrative costs) compared to other factors like program effectiveness or alignment with your values?

## Activity 2: Charitable Giving Budget Exercise

This activity will help you understand how to incorporate charitable giving into a personal budget.

### Instructions:

1. Review the sample monthly budget below:

   | Category | Amount |
   |----------|--------|
   | Income | $3,500 |
   | Housing | $1,200 |
   | Utilities | $250 |
   | Food | $500 |
   | Transportation | $300 |
   | Insurance | $200 |
   | Debt Payment | $400 |
   | Entertainment | $200 |
   | Savings | $350 |
   | Miscellaneous | $100 |
   | **Total Expenses** | **$3,500** |

2. Consider how charitable giving could be incorporated into this budget by:
   - Creating a separate category for charitable donations
   - Allocating a percentage of income (e.g., 1%, 3%, 5%)
   - Reducing spending in other categories
   - Setting up automatic monthly donations

3. Create a revised budget that includes charitable giving while maintaining financial stability.

4. Calculate the annual impact of your proposed giving plan.

5. Consider how this plan might change in different scenarios:
   - Income increases by 20%
   - Unexpected emergency requiring $1,000
   - Special one-time charitable appeal for disaster relief

> **Case Study**: Sarah, a recent college graduate, earns $3,500 monthly and wants to support educational programs for underprivileged children. Although her budget is tight with student loan payments, she decides to allocate 2% of her income ($70/month) to a local education nonprofit. To make this work, she reduces her entertainment budget by $50 and her miscellaneous spending by $20. The $840 annual donation provides after-school tutoring for two children throughout the school year. As her career advances and her income increases, Sarah plans to gradually increase her giving percentage.

## Activity 3: Non-Monetary Contributions Workshop

This collaborative activity explores ways to give back through time, skills, and other non-monetary contributions.

### Instructions:

1. Form small groups of 3-4 students.

2. Brainstorm a comprehensive list of ways people can contribute to causes without monetary donations. Consider:
   - Skills and talents (graphic design, writing, teaching, construction)
   - Time commitments (one-time events vs. ongoing volunteering)
   - Physical items (clothing, food, books, equipment)
   - Digital or social media contributions (raising awareness, advocacy)

3. Create a "Contribution Matrix" with four quadrants:
   - Low Time/Low Skill
   - Low Time/High Skill
   - High Time/Low Skill
   - High Time/High Skill

4. Place your non-monetary contribution ideas in the appropriate quadrants.

5. Discuss how different types of contributions might create value for:
   - Local organizations
   - Community members
   - Broader societal issues
   - The volunteers themselves

6. Present your group's most innovative or impactful non-monetary contribution ideas to the class.

## Activity 4: Tax Benefits Simulation

This activity will help you understand the potential tax benefits of charitable giving.

### Instructions:

1. Review the following simplified tax scenario:

   * Annual income: $60,000
   * Standard deduction: $12,950 (single filer)
   * Current itemized deductions (mortgage interest, state taxes): $11,000
   * Marginal tax rate: 22%

2. Calculate the tax impact in the following scenarios:
   * No charitable contributions
   * $2,000 in charitable contributions
   * $5,000 in charitable contributions

3. For each scenario, determine:
   * Whether to take the standard deduction or itemize
   * Total tax liability
   * Tax savings from charitable contributions
   * Effective "cost" of the donation after tax savings

4. Discuss:
   * How do tax benefits affect the overall cost of charitable giving?
   * Should tax benefits be a primary motivation for charitable giving? Why or why not?
   * How might changes in tax laws affect charitable giving?

> **Note**: This is a simplified example for educational purposes. Actual tax situations vary based on individual circumstances, additional deductions, credits, and current tax laws.

## Activity 5: Community Impact Project Planning

In this activity, you'll work in teams to design a community service project that addresses a local need.

### Instructions:

1. In groups of 4-5, identify a specific need in your school or local community.

2. Design a service project that addresses this need, including:
   * Clear project goal and expected impact
   * Required resources (time, materials, skills, funds)
   * Timeline and action steps
   * Roles and responsibilities
   * How you'll measure success

3. Create a pitch for your project that includes:
   * Why this need is important
   * How your project will address it
   * What resources you need
   * How others can get involved
   * The potential impact on the community

4. Present your project plan to the class and receive feedback.

> **Discussion Prompt**: What challenges might you face in implementing your community impact project? How could you overcome these obstacles?

## Portfolio Project: Personal Giving Strategy

For your portfolio project, you will create a comprehensive personal giving strategy that reflects your values, resources, and goals.

### Instructions:

1. Create a personal giving strategy document that includes:

   **Section 1: Values and Interests Assessment**
   * Causes and issues you feel most passionate about
   * Skills, resources, and assets you can contribute
   * Short and long-term giving goals

   **Section 2: Giving Plan**
   * Financial giving: Amount or percentage of income, frequency, and selected organizations
   * Time commitments: Volunteer hours, specific roles or activities
   * Skills contribution: How you can use your talents or expertise
   * In-kind donations: Items or resources you can provide

   **Section 3: Impact Evaluation**
   * How you'll track your contributions
   * Ways to assess the impact of your giving
   * Plan for staying informed about your chosen causes
   * Timeline for reviewing and adjusting your giving strategy

2. Include at least one visual element (chart, timeline, or infographic) that illustrates your giving strategy.

3. Add a reflection component addressing:
   * How your giving strategy aligns with your personal values
   * How you balanced giving with other financial priorities
   * What you hope to accomplish through your giving
   * How you might adjust your strategy as your circumstances change
