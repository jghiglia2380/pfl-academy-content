## Detailed Learning Lab Plan

### Warm-Up: Charitable Giving Reflection (5 minutes)

Begin the Learning Lab by having students reflect on their personal connection to charitable giving and sharing with a partner.

**Facilitation approach:**
1. Display the three reflection questions from the student content:
   - What causes or issues do you feel most passionate about? Why?
   - Have you or your family ever donated time, money, or goods to a charitable organization? What was that experience like?
   - If you could solve one problem in your community, what would it be and why?

2. Ask students to spend 2 minutes writing brief responses to these questions
3. Have students pair up and share their thoughts for 2 minutes
4. Call on 2-3 volunteers to share highlights from their discussion with the class

**Key discussion points to emphasize:**
- Personal connection to causes often drives meaningful giving
- Family experiences with giving can shape lifelong charitable habits
- Identifying problems we want to solve can help direct our charitable efforts
- There are many ways to define "community" (local, global, identity-based)

### Activity 1: Charitable Organization Research Project (15 minutes)

Guide students through researching charitable organizations aligned with their interests and evaluating their effectiveness.

**Facilitation approach:**
1. Review the concept of conducting due diligence before supporting charitable organizations
2. Demonstrate how to use charity evaluation websites by showing a quick example
3. Provide guidance on key metrics to consider:
   - Program expenses vs. administrative costs
   - Transparency in reporting
   - Evidence of impact
   - Leadership and governance
   - Alignment with stated mission

4. Have students work individually to research 2-3 organizations related to a cause they care about
5. Circulate to assist students with their research and answer questions
6. After 10 minutes, bring the class back together for discussion

**Discussion prompt:** "What criteria did you use to evaluate charitable organizations? How important is financial efficiency (low administrative costs) compared to other factors like program effectiveness or alignment with your values?"

**Teaching tips:**
- Emphasize that financial metrics alone don't tell the whole story about an organization's effectiveness
- Point out that newer or smaller organizations may have higher administrative costs but still create significant impact
- Encourage students to consider both emotional connection to a cause and objective evaluation of organizations
- Remind students that transparency in reporting is a key indicator of organizational trustworthiness

### Activity 2: Charitable Giving Budget Exercise (15 minutes)

Guide students through incorporating charitable giving into a sample budget.

**Facilitation approach:**
1. Review the sample monthly budget provided in the student content
2. Discuss different approaches to budgeting for charitable giving:
   - Creating a separate category
   - Using a percentage of income approach
   - Reducing spending in discretionary categories
   - Setting up automatic donations

3. Model one example of how to incorporate giving into the budget
4. Have students work individually to create their revised budgets
5. After students complete their budgets, ask them to calculate the annual impact
6. Lead a discussion about how giving plans might adapt to changing financial circumstances

**Case study discussion:**
Use Sarah's example from the student content to illustrate how even someone with limited resources can incorporate giving into their budget by:
- Starting with a small, manageable percentage (2%)
- Making specific tradeoffs in discretionary spending
- Having a clear understanding of the impact of their contribution
- Planning to increase giving as financial circumstances improve

**Teaching tips:**
- Emphasize that charitable giving should be intentional, not impulsive
- Highlight that giving shouldn't compromise financial stability
- Encourage students to think about the psychological benefits of planned giving vs. occasional donations
- Discuss the value of automated giving for consistency and habit-building

### Activity 3: Non-Monetary Contributions Workshop (15 minutes)

Facilitate a collaborative workshop on identifying non-monetary ways to give back.

**Facilitation approach:**
1. Organize students into small groups of 3-4
2. Provide each group with chart paper and markers
3. Explain the concept of the Contribution Matrix with the four quadrants:
   - Low Time/Low Skill
   - Low Time/High Skill
   - High Time/Low Skill
   - High Time/High Skill

4. Ask groups to brainstorm non-monetary contribution ideas for each quadrant
5. Encourage creativity and specificity in their ideas
6. After 8-10 minutes, have each group share their most innovative ideas
7. Facilitate a discussion about the value created by different types of contributions

**Examples to share if groups need inspiration:**
- Low Time/Low Skill: Sharing social media posts about causes, donating used clothing, voting on community initiatives
- Low Time/High Skill: Providing pro bono professional services, technical advice, specialized mentoring
- High Time/Low Skill: Regular volunteering at a food bank, participating in community clean-ups, visiting elderly residents
- High Time/High Skill: Serving on a nonprofit board, developing a website for an organization, providing ongoing professional services

**Teaching tips:**
- Emphasize that different life stages may allow for different types of contributions
- Highlight how skills that students take for granted may be valuable to organizations
- Discuss how the value of contributions isn't always measurable in monetary terms
- Point out that all four quadrants of contribution are valuable in different contexts

### Activity 4: Tax Benefits Simulation (15 minutes)

Guide students through understanding the potential tax benefits of charitable giving.

**Facilitation approach:**
1. Review the simplified tax scenario from the student content
2. Explain the concept of the standard deduction vs. itemizing deductions
3. Walk through the calculation for the first scenario (no charitable contributions) as a class:
   - Compare standard deduction ($12,950) to current itemized deductions ($11,000)
   - Determine that the standard deduction would be used
   - Calculate tax liability based on taxable income

4. Have students work in pairs to calculate the remaining scenarios:
   - $2,000 in charitable contributions
   - $5,000 in charitable contributions

5. Review the calculations as a class, correcting any misconceptions
6. Lead a discussion about the tax implications and the "effective cost" of donations

**Key points to emphasize:**
- In the given example, $2,000 in charitable contributions would raise itemized deductions to $13,000, making itemizing slightly more beneficial than taking the standard deduction
- The tax benefit is based on the marginal tax rate (22% in this example)
- The "effective cost" of a donation is the amount donated minus the tax savings
- Tax benefits should be viewed as a bonus, not the primary motivation for giving

**Teaching tips:**
- Acknowledge that this is a simplified example and actual tax situations are more complex
- Clarify that tax laws change periodically and may affect charitable giving incentives
- Emphasize that most high school students won't itemize deductions, but understanding the concept is valuable for future financial planning
- Discuss other tax incentives for charitable giving that aren't covered in this basic example (e.g., qualified charitable distributions from retirement accounts)

### Activity 5: Community Impact Project Planning (20 minutes)

Facilitate a group activity to design community service projects that address local needs.

**Facilitation approach:**
1. Organize students into groups of 4-5
2. Lead a brief discussion about identifying community needs:
   - School-based needs (tutoring, mentoring, club support)
   - Local community needs (food insecurity, environmental issues, elder support)
   - Youth-specific issues (recreation, education, safety)

3. Provide each group with a project planning template that includes:
   - Need identification
   - Project goal and expected impact
   - Resource requirements
   - Timeline and action steps
   - Roles and responsibilities
   - Success metrics

4. Give groups 12-15 minutes to develop their project plans
5. Have each group deliver a 1-minute pitch of their project to the class
6. Facilitate brief feedback after each presentation

**Discussion prompt:** "What challenges might you face in implementing your community impact project? How could you overcome these obstacles?"

**Teaching tips:**
- Encourage groups to think realistically about what they could accomplish
- Suggest focusing on specific, measurable outcomes rather than vague goals
- Remind students to consider both the resources required and the potential impact
- Point out that effective service projects often address root causes, not just symptoms
- Emphasize the importance of involving the affected community in planning

### Portfolio Project: Personal Giving Strategy (10 minutes)

Introduce the Personal Giving Strategy portfolio project and provide guidance for completion.

**Facilitation approach:**
1. Distribute the portfolio project guidelines handout
2. Walk through the three required sections:
   - Values and Interests Assessment
   - Giving Plan
   - Impact Evaluation

3. Show examples of visual elements students might include (charts, timelines, infographics)
4. Discuss the reflection component and its importance for connecting giving to personal values
5. Set clear expectations for completion (due date, format, evaluation criteria)
6. Answer any questions about the project requirements

**Guidance for successful completion:**
- Emphasize authenticity in the values assessment
- Encourage realistic and specific commitments in the giving plan
- Suggest concrete methods for tracking and evaluating impact
- Recommend thoughtful consideration of how giving strategies might evolve over time

### Reflection (5 minutes)

Guide students through the reflection questions and facilitate a brief class discussion.

**Facilitation approach:**
1. Have students spend 3-4 minutes writing responses to the reflection questions:
   - How has your understanding of charitable giving changed as a result of this Learning Lab?
   - What form of giving do you think will be most relevant to you in the next 5 years? Why?
   - How might integrating charitable giving into your financial planning benefit you personally while also benefiting others?
   - What is one action you commit to taking in the next month to support a cause you care about?

2. Ask 2-3 volunteers to share their responses to different questions
3. Highlight key themes and insights from student responses
4. Connect student reflections to the main learning objectives

**Teaching tips:**
- Encourage specific, actionable commitments rather than vague intentions
- Validate diverse approaches to giving based on individual circumstances
- Emphasize the connection between personal values and giving choices
- Highlight how today's learning can inform lifelong giving habits
