## Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Clarification |
|---------------|--------------|
| "Charities with low administrative costs are always better." | While efficiency matters, some administrative costs are necessary for effective operations. Extremely low administrative costs could indicate underinvestment in necessary infrastructure. |
| "All charities with similar names are related or equally legitimate." | Many questionable organizations use names similar to well-known charities. Always verify the specific organization using its EIN (Employer Identification Number). |
| "Small, local charities are less effective than large, national ones." | Size doesn't determine effectiveness. Local organizations may have lower overhead and more direct community impact, while larger organizations may have economies of scale. |
| "High executive salaries always indicate a bad charity." | While excessive compensation is a concern, competitive salaries may be necessary to attract qualified leadership for complex organizations. Context matters. |

## Additional Notes

- Emphasize critical thinking and decision-making throughout the lesson.
- Encourage students to think about the potential impact of their contributions.
- Remind students that informed giving ensures donations are used effectively.
- Connect this lesson to previous discussions about budgeting and values-based financial decisions.

## Extension Activities

- Have students create a "Charity Evaluation Guide" for their school or community.
- Organize a service-learning project with a thoroughly researched local organization.
- Invite a representative from a local community foundation to discuss grant-making processes.
- Research and compare "effective altruism" approaches to traditional charitable giving.
