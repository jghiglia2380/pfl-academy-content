# Checking Out Charitable Groups: Learning Lab

## Overview

Welcome to the Learning Lab for Checking Out Charitable Groups! Today, you'll apply what you learned about evaluating charitable organizations through hands-on activities. You'll analyze real nonprofits, develop evaluation criteria, create a personal giving plan, and participate in a mock grant committee. These interactive experiences will help you become a more informed and effective charitable contributor.

## Warm-Up: Podcast Recap (5 minutes)

Take a few minutes to reflect on the key points from yesterday's lesson on evaluating charitable organizations:
- Why is research important before donating to a charity?
- What are some key indicators of a well-run charitable organization?
- What tools can help you evaluate a charity's effectiveness?

## Activity 1: Charity Evaluation Workshop (15 minutes)

In this activity, you'll conduct a thorough analysis of a real charitable organization using professional evaluation tools.

### Instructions:

1. Form small groups of 2-3 students.
2. Each group will be assigned one of the following well-known charitable organizations:
   - American Red Cross
   - Habitat for Humanity
   - World Wildlife Fund
   - Feeding America
   - UNICEF

3. Using the charity evaluation tools (Charity Navigator, GuideStar, etc.), research your assigned organization and complete the Charity Evaluation Worksheet with the following information:
   - Mission and programs
   - Financial health (program expense ratio, fundraising efficiency)
   - Transparency and accountability measures
   - Leadership structure and compensation
   - Measurable impact and outcomes
   - Any concerns or red flags

4. Create a brief presentation (2-3 minutes) to share your findings with the class. Be prepared to recommend whether this organization would be a good choice for donors and explain your reasoning.

## Activity 2: Developing Your Charity Evaluation Criteria (15 minutes)

In this activity, you'll develop a personalized framework for evaluating charitable organizations based on your own values and priorities.

### Instructions:

1. Review the different aspects of charitable organizations that can be evaluated:
   - Financial efficiency and transparency
   - Program effectiveness and impact measurement
   - Leadership and governance
   - Accountability and communication
   - Alignment with personal values

2. Create your own Charity Evaluation Scorecard with 5-7 criteria that matter most to you. For each criterion:
   - Assign a weight (1-5 points) based on how important it is to you
   - Create a scoring system (1-5 stars) for each criterion
   - Develop specific questions or metrics to assess each criterion

3. Test your evaluation framework by applying it to a charity you're familiar with.

4. Share your framework with a partner and discuss:
   - Why did you prioritize certain criteria over others?
   - How might this framework change depending on the type of charity or cause?
   - What did you learn about your own values through this process?

## Activity 3: Charitable Giving Plan Simulation (20 minutes)

In this activity, you'll create a charitable giving plan that aligns with your values, budget, and desired impact.

### Instructions:

2. Complete the following steps in your Charitable Giving Plan:
   - Define your philanthropic mission statement (1-2 sentences about what you hope to accomplish with your giving)
   - Identify 2-3 cause areas that align with your values and interests
   - Research and select 2-4 charitable organizations across your chosen cause areas
   - Allocate your $1,000 budget across these organizations, explaining your reasoning
   - Determine how you'll track the impact of your donations throughout the year

3. Consider ways to maximize your impact beyond financial donations:
   - Volunteering opportunities with your selected organizations
   - Advocacy or awareness-raising activities
   - Skills-based contributions
   - Workplace matching programs or donor-advised funds

4. Share your plan with a small group and provide feedback on each other's approaches.

## Activity 4: Mock Grant Committee (25 minutes)

In this activity, you'll experience the decision-making process of a philanthropic foundation by evaluating grant proposals from different organizations.

### Instructions:

3. Review the four grant proposal summaries provided, which include:
   - Organization background and mission
   - Project description and goals
   - Budget breakdown
   - Expected outcomes and impact measurement plan

4. As a committee, develop evaluation criteria and a decision-making process.
