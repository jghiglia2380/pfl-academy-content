- Encourage reflection on long-term credit management goals
- Summarize key takeaways from the two-day lesson

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Struggling Students

- Provide additional guidance on using the calculator tool
- Offer simplified scenarios with fewer variables to consider
- Create a template for the decision matrix with pre-populated categories
- Consider pairing students for collaborative work

### For Advanced Students

- Present more complex scenarios with multiple variables
- Challenge them to consider economic factors that might affect interest rates
- Have them research and incorporate additional credit sources not covered in class
- Encourage them to create more sophisticated decision matrices with weighted factors

## Teaching Notes

### Facilitation Tips

- Monitor the room during the calculator activity to ensure students understand how to use the tool
- During discussions about predatory lending, maintain sensitivity to students' diverse backgrounds
- When reviewing personal credit plans, avoid judgmental language about credit choices
- Emphasize that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to credit decisions

### Connections to Real Life

- Encourage students to discuss how these concepts relate to financial decisions they or their families have made
- Highlight how understanding credit sources now will benefit them in near-future decisions (college, first car, etc.)
- When appropriate, share relevant personal examples of credit decisions (while maintaining privacy)
- Connect to current events or recent news about credit markets or consumer protection

## Assessment Strategies

### Formative Assessment

- Check student calculations for accuracy during the calculator activity
- Listen for reasoning during scenario discussions
- Review decision matrices for logical criteria and priorities

### Summative Assessment

- Evaluate the completeness and practicality of personal credit plans
- Assess students' ability to identify predatory practices in the case study
- Consider the sophistication of students' credit source analyses
