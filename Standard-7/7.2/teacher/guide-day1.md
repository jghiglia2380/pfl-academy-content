- Introduce and define key terms:
  - Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
  - Collateral
  - Installment vs. Non-Installment Credit

  - Typical interest rates and fees
  - Advantages and disadvantages
  - Best use cases
- Use visual aids to compare different sources side-by-side

- Emphasize the importance of looking beyond monthly payments to understand total cost

### Real-World Scenarios Analysis (10 minutes)

- For each scenario, ask students:
  - "Which option would you choose and why?"

### Skill Builder Activity (12 minutes)

- Preview the Learning Lab activities for Day 2

## Differentiation Strategies

- For advanced students: Challenge them to calculate and compare the total cost of loans with different terms
- For struggling students: Provide a simplified comparison chart focusing on the most important factors
- Visual learners: Use color-coded materials and diagrams to highlight key differences
- Collaborative option: Allow students to work in pairs for the scenario analysis

## Assessment Opportunities

- Formative: Monitor student participation in discussions and scenario analyses
- Check for Understanding: Review responses to borrowing scenarios
- Skill Builder: Evaluate student choices for credit sources in different scenarios
- Reflection: Assess depth of understanding in written reflections

## Common Misconceptions to Address

- "All credit is bad" - Clarify that credit can be a useful tool when used responsibly
- "Interest rate is the only important factor" - Emphasize the importance of considering all terms and conditions
- "Payday loans are a good option for quick cash" - Highlight the extremely high costs and potential debt cycle
- "Only people with financial problems use credit" - Discuss strategic uses of credit even when cash is available
