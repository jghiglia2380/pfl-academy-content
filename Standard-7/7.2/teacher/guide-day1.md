## Detailed Lesson Plan

### Introduction (8 minutes)

- Begin by asking students if they've ever borrowed money (formally or informally) and what that experience was like
- Introduce the concept of credit and why people borrow money
- Explain the learning objectives for the day's lesson
- Define key terms: APR, collateral, installment credit, non-installment credit, creditworthiness

### Direct Instruction: Credit Sources Overview (12 minutes)

- Present and explain each credit source (commercial banks, credit unions, consumer finance companies, online lenders, peer-to-peer lending, payday lenders, retailer credit)
- For each source, highlight:
  - Typical interest rates
  - Qualification requirements
  - Advantages and disadvantages
  - Who typically uses this source and why

### Comparing Credit Options (10 minutes)

- Walk through the factors for comparing credit sources
- Emphasize that APR is the most important factor for cost comparison
- Explain how loan terms affect total cost and monthly payments
- Discuss how fees can significantly impact the true cost of borrowing
- Touch on the importance of considering flexibility, customer service, and other non-cost factors

### Real-World Borrowing Scenarios (10 minutes)

- Present each of the three scenarios
- Guide students through analyzing the options
- Calculate the total cost for at least one scenario to demonstrate how to compare options
- Ask students which option they would choose and why
- Point out that the "best" option sometimes depends on individual circumstances

### Skill Builder Activity (10 minutes)

- Introduce the Comparing Credit Sources activity
- Guide students through the chart of different lender types
- Have students work independently to match scenarios with the most appropriate lender
- Prompt students to reflect on why payday lenders exist despite high costs

### Reflection and Wrap-Up (5 minutes)

- Direct students to complete the reflection prompt
- Highlight key takeaways about responsible borrowing
- Preview how Day 2 will build on these concepts with practical applications
- Answer any remaining questions

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Struggling Students

- Simplify the APR concept by providing concrete examples
- Focus on the most common credit sources first before introducing more complex options
- Provide a simple comparison chart that highlights just the key differences between sources
- Consider pairing students for the activity to allow peer support

### For Advanced Students

- Challenge them to calculate the total cost of borrowing for various scenarios
- Have them research additional credit sources not covered in the lesson
- Ask them to analyze more complex scenarios with multiple variables
- Encourage them to consider how different life circumstances might affect credit choices

## Common Misconceptions and Teaching Notes

### Common Misconceptions

- Students may think the lowest monthly payment is always the best option. Emphasize that total cost matters more than payment size.
- Many students believe all credit is "bad." Clarify that responsible use of credit is an important financial tool.
- Students might not understand how greatly interest rates can vary between sources. Use real numbers to show dramatic differences.
- Some may think payday loans are a reasonable option. Ensure they understand the extreme costs involved.

### Teaching Notes

- Avoid making assumptions about students' family financial situations, as some may come from households that rely on alternative financial services
- When discussing payday lenders, be factual about the high costs while acknowledging why people sometimes feel they have no other options
- Connect concepts to students' lives by relating to purchases they might make (phones, cars, education)
- Throughout the lesson, emphasize that borrowing is a tool that should be used strategically, not habitually

## Assessment Strategies

### Formative Assessment

- Monitor student engagement during discussions of credit sources
- Check for understanding through targeted questions during scenario analysis
- Observe student work during the Skill Builder activity to identify misconceptions

### Summative Assessment

- Review student responses to the reflection prompt to gauge understanding
- Evaluate students' scenario matching in the Skill Builder activity
- Consider how well students can articulate the factors that make a credit source appropriate for specific situations
