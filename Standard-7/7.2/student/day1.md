## Introduction to Credit Sources

Credit is available from many different sources, each with their own advantages, disadvantages, and specific purposes:

### Commercial Banks

- Offer a wide range of credit products (credit cards, personal loans, mortgages)
- Generally require good credit scores
- Typically offer competitive interest rates
- May have stricter qualification requirements

### Credit Unions

- Member-owned, not-for-profit financial cooperatives
- Often offer lower interest rates and fees than commercial banks
- May have more flexible lending criteria
- Require membership based on specific criteria (employer, location, etc.)

### Consumer Finance Companies

- Specialize in personal loans, often for those with less-than-perfect credit
- Higher interest rates than banks or credit unions
- More flexible qualification standards
- Examples: Personal loan companies like Avant, OneMain Financial

### Online Lenders

- Operate exclusively online without physical branches
- Often have streamlined application processes
- May offer competitive rates for borrowers with good credit
- Examples include SoFi, LendingClub, Prosper

### Peer-to-Peer Lending

- Platforms connecting individual borrowers with individual lenders
- Interest rates vary based on creditworthiness
- Often used for debt consolidation or personal projects
- Examples include LendingClub, Prosper

### Payday Lenders

- Offer small, short-term loans with very high interest rates
- Often target borrowers with poor credit or limited options
- Can lead to debt cycles due to extremely high costs
- Should generally be considered only as a last resort

### Retailer Credit

- Store credit cards or financing programs
- Often have special promotions (0% interest for 12 months, etc.)
- Higher standard interest rates than traditional credit cards
- May have deferred interest penalties

## Comparing Credit Options

When evaluating credit sources, compare these key factors:

1. **Annual Percentage Rate (APR)**: The true cost of borrowing, including interest and fees
2. **Loan Terms**: The length of time you have to repay the loan
3. **Fees**: Application fees, origination fees, late payment fees, prepayment penalties
4. **Minimum Credit Score**: The lowest score the lender will accept
5. **Collateral Requirements**: Whether the loan requires security (home, car, etc.)
6. **Repayment Flexibility**: Options for payment frequency, amount adjustments, etc.
7. **Customer Service**: Availability of support and quality of customer experience

## Skill Builder: Comparing Credit Sources

### Instructions:

1. Review the following Chart: Begin by carefully reading through the chart provided on the different types of credit sources, such as consumer finance companies, online lenders, credit unions, and payday lenders. Make sure to understand each lender's typical uses, interest rates, fees, and ideal scenarios for borrowing.
2. Analyze the Scenarios: Next, examine the provided scenarios in the Comparing Credit Sources Table. Identify the most suitable lender for each scenario based on your understanding of the chart. Think about factors like interest rates, fees, and whether the loan type fits the specific needs of the scenario.
3. Reflection Prompt: After completing the table, answer the reflection question: Based on what you've learned, why do you think payday lenders continue to be legal despite their high costs? What alternatives could someone use if they're in a financial emergency and don't have access to other borrowing options?
