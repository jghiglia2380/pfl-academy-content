### Introduction (5 minutes)

- Begin with the prompt about credit card/loan advertisements

### FICO Score Breakdown (10 minutes)

- Display the FICO score components visual
- Emphasize the two highest-weighted factors (payment history and credit utilization)
- Activity: Have students rank which factors they believe they can most easily control
- Facilitate brief discussion comparing their rankings to actual FICO weighting

### Real-World Impact (10 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups
- Assign each group one impact area (housing, employment, insurance, utilities, or interest rates)

  - How could a bad credit score affect someone in this area?
  - What might be the long-term consequences?
  - How could someone overcome these challenges?

### Real-World Examples Discussion (5 minutes)

- Present Jason and Sophia's stories
- Ask students:
  - "What specific credit score factor was most affected in each scenario?"
  - "What could each person have done differently?"
- Highlight the interconnected nature of credit score factors

### Skill Builder Activity (10 minutes)

- Direct students to complete the digital Skill Builder worksheet
- Circulate to assist students and address misconceptions

  - Credit scores impact many aspects of financial life
  - Scores are based on specific behaviors and patterns
  - Actions today affect financial opportunities tomorrow
- Preview Day 2: "Tomorrow we'll use a simulator to see how different decisions affect credit scores and create your personal credit strategy."

## Assessment Opportunities

- Informal: Monitor small group discussions for misconceptions

## Differentiation

- Support: Provide a simplified credit score factors handout for students who need additional scaffolding
- Extension: Have advanced students research and compare different credit scoring models beyond FICO
