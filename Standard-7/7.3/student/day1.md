# Understanding Credit Scores

## Objective

By the end of this lesson, you will understand the importance of credit scores, how they are calculated, and their impact on various aspects of life. You will be able to identify actions that improve or harm your credit score and recognize the long-term effects of your credit behavior on financial opportunities.

## Introduction

Think about the last time you saw an advertisement for a loan or credit card. What stood out to you? Was it the interest rate? The promise of "low monthly payments"? These offers aren't available to everyone equallyâ€”lenders use credit scores to determine who qualifies for their best rates and terms.

## Key Concepts

- **Credit Score**: A numerical representation of creditworthiness, typically ranging from 300 to 850.
- **FICO Score**: The most widely used credit scoring model in the U.S.
- **Credit Report**: A detailed record of your credit history, including borrowing habits and repayment history.
- **Credit Utilization**: The percentage of available credit you're using.
- **Hard vs. Soft Credit Inquiries**: Hard inquiries (when you apply for credit) impact your score; soft inquiries (like checking your own score) don't.
- **Payment History**: Your record of on-time or missed payments, accounting for 35% of your FICO score.
- **Credit Mix**: Having different types of credit (credit cards, loans) can boost scores.
- **Credit Bureaus**: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion compile credit reports and provide credit scores.

## The FICO Score Breakdown

Your FICO score is made up of five key components, each weighted differently:

- Payment History (35%)
- Credit Utilization (30%)
- Length of Credit History (15%)
- Credit Mix (10%)
- New Credit (10%)

## Real-World Impact

Your credit score affects more than just loan approvals:

- **Housing**: Landlords check credit scores before approving rental applications
- **Employment**: Some employers review credit as part of background checks
- **Insurance**: Many insurers use credit-based insurance scores to set premiums
- **Utilities**: Deposits may be waived for those with good credit
- **Interest Rates**: The difference between a 650 and 750 score could mean thousands of dollars in extra interest on a mortgage

## Real-World Examples

**Jason's Story**: Jason applied for three credit cards within a month, thinking he could compare offers. Each application created a hard inquiry on his credit report, lowering his score by 25 points. Now he's having trouble getting approved for an apartment lease because his score dropped below the landlord's minimum requirement.

**Sophia's Story**: Sophia closed her oldest credit card account to simplify her finances. She didn't realize this would shorten her credit history length and increase her overall credit utilization ratio. Her score dropped 40 points, affecting her ability to qualify for a low-interest auto loan.

## Skill Builder Activity: Understanding the Factors That Affect Your Credit Score

### Instructions:

1. **Review the Chart:**
   - Carefully study the chart, which breaks down the five key factors that influence your credit score: Payment History (35%), Current Debt Level/Credit Utilization (30%), Length of Credit History (15%), Types of Credit Used (10%), and New Credit/Pursuit of New Credit (10%).

2. **Reflect on the Categories:**
   - Consider each category and how it might apply to your current or future financial situation. Reflect on which factor seems like it would be easiest to control and improve, and which might present the greatest challenge for you.

3. **Answer the Reflection Prompt:**
   - Based on these categories, which factor do you think would be easiest for you to control and improve?
   - Which one might be the most challenging, and why?
   - Write a short paragraph explaining your thoughts.

4. **Submit Your Response:**
   - After completing the reflection, submit your response to the instructor for feedback.
