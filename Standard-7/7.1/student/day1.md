# Understanding the Cost of Borrowing

## Introduction

Borrowing money is a financial tool that can help you achieve important goals, but it also comes with costs and responsibilities. Today, we'll explore when borrowing makes sense, how interest and fees affect loans, and the differences between various types of credit.

## Key Concepts

- **Principal**: The original amount of money borrowed
- **Interest Rate**: The percentage charged by a lender for borrowing money
- **Annual Percentage Rate (APR)**: The yearly cost of borrowing, including interest and fees
- **Secured Credit**: Credit backed by collateral (like a car or house)
- **Unsecured Credit**: Credit not backed by collateral (like credit cards)
- **Collateral**: An asset pledged to secure a loan
- **Default**: Failure to repay a loan according to the agreed terms
- **Debt-to-Income Ratio**: The ratio of monthly debt payments to monthly gross income
- **Credit Score**: A number representing creditworthiness based on credit history

## Types of Credit

### Secured vs. Unsecured Credit

- **Secured Credit**: Requires collateral that the lender can take if you don't repay
    - Examples: Auto loans, mortgages
    - Usually has lower interest rates
    - Less risky for lenders, which is why rates are lower
- **Unsecured Credit**: No collateral required
    - Examples: Credit cards, personal loans, student loans
    - Usually has higher interest rates
    - More risky for lenders, which is why rates are higher

### Installment vs. Non-Installment Credit

- **Installment Credit**: Fixed number of equal payments over a set period
    - Examples: Auto loans, mortgages, personal loans
    - You know exactly how much you'll pay each month
- **Non-Installment Credit**: Flexible repayment and revolving credit availability
    - Examples: Credit cards, lines of credit
    - Minimum payment required monthly, but you can pay more
    - As you pay down the balance, credit becomes available again

## Understanding Interest and Fees

Interest can significantly impact the total cost of borrowing:

**Example 1**: Student Loan

- Principal: $10,000
- Interest Rate: 4.5%
- Term: 10 years
- Monthly Payment: $103.64
- Total Interest Paid: $2,437
- Total Cost: $12,437

**Example 2**: Credit Card

- Principal: $10,000
- Interest Rate: 18%
- Making only minimum payments
- Time to pay off: 28 years
- Total Interest Paid: $15,432
- Total Cost: $25,432

## Real-World Examples

**Julia's Student Loan Decision**
Julia is considering taking out a student loan for college. She's been offered:

- Federal loan: 4.5% interest, deferred payments until after graduation
- Private loan: 6.8% interest, requiring immediate partial payments

Julia chooses the federal loan because of the lower interest rate and more flexible repayment options, recognizing that this will save her thousands of dollars over the life of the loan.

**Ravi's Car Purchase**
Ravi needs a reliable car for work. He can:

- Pay $15,000 in cash for a used car
- Finance a $25,000 newer car at 5.9% interest for 5 years

Ravi decides to buy the used car because:

- No monthly payments or interest costs
- Lower insurance premiums
- The car still meets his needs for reliable transportation
- He avoids taking on debt that would affect his budget for years

## Reflection Prompt

Think about a situation where borrowing money might be a good idea and one where it might be a bad idea. Write a brief paragraph explaining why you think borrowing is a smart choice in one scenario and not in the other.

## Skill Builder: Loan Comparison Chart

This chart provides an overview of various loan types commonly used for significant purchases, such as education, cars, or homes. Carefully review the key details of each loan type, including the typical interest rates, loan terms, potential fees, and ideal usage scenarios.

How to Use the Chart: Take time to study each loan type. Compare the interest rates, fees, and loan terms to understand the costs associated with each. Pay attention to how the loans vary in their intended purposes and the specific circumstances in which each type of loan might be most appropriate.

[LOAN COMPARISON CHART]

Reflection Prompt: After reviewing the chart, respond to the following questions:

1. Which type of loan do you think would be the most challenging to manage over time, and why?
2. If you had to borrow money for a large purchase (e.g., a car or education), which loan type would you choose, and what factors would influence your decision? Consider factors such as interest rates, fees, repayment terms, and the specific financial needs that each loan type addresses.
