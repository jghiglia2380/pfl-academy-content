## Detailed Lesson Plan

### Introduction (5 minutes)

- Begin by asking students: "Has anyone in your family ever taken out a loan? What was it for?"
- Discuss common reasons people borrow money: education, homes, cars, emergencies
- Emphasize that borrowing can be a useful financial tool when used wisely, but can lead to financial problems when misused

### Key Concepts of Borrowing (12 minutes)

- Introduce and define the key borrowing terms listed in the student content
- Use a simple example to illustrate how loans work:
  "If you borrow $1,000 at 5% interest for a year, you'll pay back $1,050."
- Ask students to calculate how much they would pay back on a $2,000 loan at 8% for one year ($2,160)
- Explain that borrowing costs extend beyond just the principal and can add up quickly

### Types of Credit (10 minutes)

- Explain the differences between secured and unsecured credit
- Discuss installment versus non-installment credit
- Use relatable examples:
  - "A car loan is secured by the car itself – if you don't pay, the lender can take your car"
  - "A credit card is unsecured – there's no specific item the lender can take if you don't pay"
- Ask students: "Why do you think secured loans usually have lower interest rates than unsecured loans?" (Because there's less risk for the lender)

### Understanding Interest and Fees (10 minutes)

- Walk through the example calculations in the student materials
- Highlight the dramatic difference in total cost between the student loan and credit card examples
- Ask students to identify what makes the credit card example so much more expensive (higher interest rate, longer repayment period due to minimum payments)
- Discuss how fees like origination fees, late fees, and annual fees can add to borrowing costs

### Real-World Examples (8 minutes)

- Review Julia's and Ravi's scenarios from the student materials
- For each example, ask students:
  - "What factors did this person consider when making their decision?"
  - "What were the financial implications of their choice?"
  - "Would you have made the same decision? Why or why not?"

### Skill Builder Activity (10 minutes)

- Direct students to review the Loan Comparison Chart
- Instruct students to study the different loan types and their characteristics
- Have students complete the reflection questions:
  1. Which type of loan would be most challenging to manage over time, and why?
  2. Which loan type would they choose for a large purchase, and what factors would influence this decision?

### Reflection and Wrap-Up (5 minutes)

- Ask students to complete the main reflection prompt: "Think about a situation where borrowing money might be a good idea and one where it might be a bad idea."
- If time permits, have 2-3 students share their reflections
- Summarize key takeaways:
  - Borrowing has costs beyond just repaying what you borrowed
  - Different types of loans serve different purposes
  - Responsible borrowing requires understanding the terms and evaluating if you can afford repayment

## Differentiation Strategies

- For advanced students: Ask them to calculate the total cost of a loan with different interest rates or terms
- For struggling students: Provide simplified examples focusing on the basic concept that borrowing costs money
- Visual learners: Draw or display graphs showing how interest accumulates over time

## Assessment Opportunities

- Informal: Monitor student responses during discussions
- Formal: Review student reflections and Skill Builder responses
- Exit ticket: "Name one factor you should consider before taking out a loan"
