# Understanding the Cost of Borrowing: Learning Lab Teacher Guide

## Learning Lab Overview

This Learning Lab allows students to apply their knowledge of borrowing concepts through interactive activities and simulations. Students will calculate loan costs using different variables, compare borrowing scenarios, and develop a personal framework for making responsible borrowing decisions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Calculate the total cost of various loan options
- Compare different borrowing scenarios to identify the most cost-effective options
- Develop a personal framework for making responsible borrowing decisions
- Apply knowledge about loans to create a strategic approach to borrowing

## Materials Needed

- Digital devices with access to the Learning Lab platform
- Headphones for podcast review
- Access to the interactive loan calculator
- Digital worksheets for the Real-Cost Analysis

## Learning Lab Timeline

| Podcast Review | 10 minutes | Listen to podcast reviewing Day 1 concepts |
| Loan Calculator Activity | 15 minutes | Explore how different variables affect loan costs |
| Borrowing Decision Simulator | 15 minutes | Work through realistic borrowing scenarios |
| Real-Cost Analysis and Portfolio | 10 minutes | Compare payment strategies and develop borrowing framework |
| Reflection and Debrief | 5 minutes | Share insights and discuss perspective changes |

## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Podcast Review (10 minutes)

- Have students listen to the pre-recorded podcast that reviews key concepts from Day 1:
  - Principal, interest, and APR
  - Secured vs. unsecured credit
  - Installment vs. non-installment credit
  - Factors affecting total loan cost
- After listening, ask 2-3 students to share one key concept they remember from Day 1

### Loan Calculator Activity (15 minutes)

- Introduce the interactive loan calculator
- Demonstrate how to input different variables:
  - Principal amount
  - Interest rate
  - Loan term
  - Payment frequency
- Guided practice: Walk through calculating the cost of a $20,000 car loan at 5.9% for 5 years
- Independent practice: Have students explore how changing each variable affects the total cost:
  - What happens if you extend the term to 7 years? (Lower payments but higher total cost)
  - What happens if the interest rate increases by 2%? (Higher payments and total cost)
  - What happens if you make biweekly instead of monthly payments? (Pay off faster, less interest)

### Borrowing Decision Simulator (15 minutes)

- Direct students to the Borrowing Decision Simulator on the Learning Lab platform
- Explain that they will work through scenarios that require borrowing decisions
- For each scenario, students should:
  - Analyze the available information
  - Evaluate different borrowing options
  - Make a decision based on the financial implications
  - Justify their choice
- Circulate while students work to provide guidance and check understanding

### Real-Cost Analysis and Portfolio Development (10 minutes)

- Have students complete the Real-Cost Analysis activity, comparing different payment strategies
- Direct students to use insights from their analysis to begin creating their Borrowing Strategy Portfolio
- Explain that this portfolio will serve as a personal guide for making future borrowing decisions

### Reflection and Debrief (5 minutes)

- Ask students to share one surprising thing they learned about the cost of borrowing
- Discuss how these activities changed their perspective on taking out loans
- Preview how their Borrowing Strategy Portfolio will help them make more informed financial decisions

## Differentiation Strategies

- For advanced students: Add more complex scenarios with variable interest rates or balloon payments
- For struggling students: Provide guided worksheets with step-by-step instructions
- Group option: Allow students to work in pairs on the simulator activity

## Assessment Opportunities

- Review students' loan calculations for accuracy
- Evaluate decision-making process in the simulator activity
- Assess the completeness and thoughtfulness of the Borrowing Strategy Portfolio
- Monitor student participation during discussions

## Homework/Extension

- Suggest that students interview a family member about a significant loan they've taken (mortgage, car loan, etc.) to understand their decision-making process
- Encourage students to research current interest rates for different types of loans to gain awareness of the current lending environment
