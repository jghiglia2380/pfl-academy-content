- Student devices for digital reflection activity

## Lesson Plan

### Introduction (5 minutes)

- Begin by asking students if they've ever heard of consumer credit laws or if they know any ways consumers are protected when borrowing money.
- Explain the importance of understanding consumer protections before entering into credit agreements.
- Review the learning objectives for the day.

### Key Vocabulary and Concepts (10 minutes)

- Introduce and explain each key term:
  - Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
  - Truth in Lending Act (TILA)
  - Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)
  - Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)
  - Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)
  - Credit CARD Act
- Use everyday examples to help students understand how these terms relate to their financial lives.

### Consumer Protection Scenarios Discussion (15 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups and assign each group one of the scenarios.
- Allow 5 minutes for groups to discuss which laws might apply and how they protect consumers.
- Have each group share their analysis with the class (2 minutes per group).
- Provide feedback and correct any misconceptions about the applicable laws.

Suggested answers for scenarios:

1. **Javier scenario**: TILA requires clear disclosure of credit terms; CARD Act protects against misleading offers
2. **Sophia scenario**: ECOA prohibits discrimination based on gender, race, or ethnicity
3. **Marcus scenario**: FCRA gives consumers the right to dispute inaccurate information
4. **Lena scenario**: FDCPA prohibits debt collectors from calling outside of 8 AM - 9 PM

### Why Consumer Credit Laws Matter (15 minutes)

Facilitate a broader discussion about:

- Historical reasons these laws were created (addressing problems in lending markets)
- How these laws affect students' everyday lives
- The balance between consumer protection and credit availability
- The role of government agencies in enforcing these laws

Discussion prompts:

- "Why might lenders withhold information if not required by law to disclose it?"
- "How might lending practices be different without anti-discrimination laws?"
- "What happens if there's no enforcement mechanism for these laws?"

### Skill Builder Activity (10 minutes)

- Guide students through the Consumer Credit Laws Table.
- Emphasize the chronological development of these laws and how they build upon each other.
- Have students complete the reflection questions individually on their devices.
- If time allows, ask for volunteers to share their responses, particularly their ideas for new consumer credit laws.

## Assessment

- Monitor student participation in group and class discussions
- Review student responses to reflection questions
- Note creative thinking in proposed new consumer credit laws

## Differentiation

- Advanced students: Encourage them to research recent cases involving consumer credit law violations
- Students needing support: Provide simplified versions of the laws' key provisions
- ELL students: Offer vocabulary support and visual representations of key concepts
