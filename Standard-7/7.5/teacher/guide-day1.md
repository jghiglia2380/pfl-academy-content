### Teaching Tips

- Relate student loan concepts to students' actual college plans to increase relevance.
- Use concrete examples and real numbers throughout the lesson.
- Be sensitive to varying socioeconomic backgrounds; some students may be more dependent on loans than others.
- Emphasize that student loans can be a valuable tool when used responsibly.
- Connect student loan decisions to broader financial wellness concepts from previous lessons.

### Discussion Prompts

- "What surprised you most about the differences between federal and private student loans?"
- "How might your career choice impact your student loan borrowing decisions?"
- "What strategies beyond loans might help finance your education?"
- "How would you balance working during college with your academic responsibilities?"

### Addressing Misconceptions

- Clarify that not all student debt is "bad" - it's an investment when managed properly.
- Address the myth that student loans are automatically forgiven - emphasize the specific requirements for forgiveness programs.
- Explain that deferment isn't free - interest often still accrues during this period.

### Assessment Strategies

- Monitor participation in discussions and case study analysis.
- Review responses to the budget activity for understanding of cost-saving strategies.
- Evaluate final reflection responses for depth of understanding and application to personal circumstances.
