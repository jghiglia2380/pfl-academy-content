# Planning for Retirement

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Differentiate between saving and investing strategies
- Identify key financial concepts like liquidity, risk tolerance, and opportunity cost
- Explain the relationship between risk and return
- Develop financial strategies based on time horizons and goals
- Understand how diversification helps manage risk

## Key Vocabulary

- Saving: Setting aside money for short-term needs with minimal risk
- Investing: Committing money to financial products with the goal of generating returns over time
- Liquidity: How quickly an asset can be converted to cash without significant loss of value
- Risk tolerance: Your ability and willingness to endure market fluctuations
- Opportunity cost: What you give up when making one financial choice over another
- Compounding: The process where the returns on your money generate their own returns
- Diversification: Spreading investments across different assets to reduce risk

## Opening Discussion

Think about your current financial goals. Are you saving for something specific? Have you thought about investing for long-term needs like college or retirement?

## Saving vs. Investing: What's the Difference?

| Saving | Investing |
| --- | --- |
| Short-term needs (1-3 years) | Long-term goals (3+ years) |
| Lower risk | Higher risk (varies by investment type) |
| Lower returns | Potential for higher returns |
| Examples: Savings accounts, CDs | Examples: Stocks, bonds, mutual funds |
| Goal: Preserve capital | Goal: Grow capital |

## The Risk-Return Relationship

- Higher potential returns typically come with higher risk
- Lower risk generally means lower potential returns
- Your time horizon affects how much risk you can reasonably take

## Time Horizons and Risk

- Short-term goals (1-3 years): Low-risk saving vehicles are appropriate
- Medium-term goals (3-10 years): A mix of saving and conservative investments
- Long-term goals (10+ years): Can typically withstand higher risk for potential growth

## Group Activity: Financial Product Analysis

In small groups, you'll be assigned one of the following financial products to analyze:

1. High-yield savings account
2. Certificate of Deposit (CD)
3. Corporate bond
4. Index fund
5. Individual stock

For your assigned product, discuss and prepare to present:

- Key features and how it works
- Typical returns compared to risk level
- Liquidity (how easily you can access your money)
- Ideal time horizon
- Who might benefit most from this product

## Reflection Prompt

Imagine yourself at age 65. What kind of lifestyle do you envision for yourself? What steps can you start taking now to ensure you have enough savings to achieve that lifestyle?

## Skill Builder: Retirement Planning Worksheet

### Objective

In this activity, you will explore different retirement options, including Social Security, 401(k) plans, IRAs, and annuities. You'll use the provided worksheet to compare the benefits, risks, and tax implications of each option and answer the reflection question about your personal financial goals for retirement.

### Steps

1. Review the Retirement Options: Look at the spreadsheet provided, which outlines different retirement options (Social Security, 401(k), Traditional IRA, Roth IRA, Annuities). For each retirement option, understand the benefits, potential risks, tax implications, ideal usage scenarios, maximum contribution limits, and expected returns.

2. Reflection Question: After reviewing the retirement options, answer the following reflection question at the bottom of the worksheet:
    
    Using the 50/30/20 rule, if you want to maximize contributions to a 401(k) ($22,500), a Traditional IRA ($6,500), and a Roth IRA ($6,500), how much would you need to earn annually to allocate these investments while keeping them at 20% of your total income? Calculate your target annual income to hit this goal.
    
3. Calculation: Use the information provided in the worksheet to calculate the total maximum contribution to the retirement accounts ($22,500 + $6,500 + $6,500). Apply the 50/30/20 rule and use the 20% allocation to figure out what annual income is needed to contribute the maximum allowed while keeping retirement savings within that percentage of your income.

4. Provide your calculated answer and explain the process you used to arrive at it.
