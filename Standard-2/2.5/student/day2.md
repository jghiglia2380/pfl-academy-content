## Introduction

Welcome to the Learning Lab! Today, you'll apply what you learned about tax planning and compliance by participating in interactive simulations, building a personal tax planning portfolio, and testing your knowledge of tax compliance requirements. These hands-on activities will help you develop practical tax planning skills that you can use throughout your life.
