## Tax Planning vs. Tax Evasion

- **Tax Planning**: Legal strategies to reduce tax liability through deductions, credits, and timing of income and expenses
  - Example: Contributing to a traditional IRA to reduce your taxable income
  - Example: Timing a major charitable donation to maximize tax benefits
  - Example: Taking legitimate business deductions for qualifying expenses

- **Tax Evasion**: Illegal non-payment or underpayment of taxes through deception or fraud
  - Example: Not reporting cash income on your tax return
  - Example: Claiming fictitious dependents to increase tax credits
  - Example: Using personal expenses as business deductions when they don't qualify

## Core Tax Planning Strategies

### 1. Timing of Income and Expenses

- Accelerating or deferring income when beneficial
  - Deferring year-end bonuses to the next year if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket
  - Accelerating income if tax rates are expected to increase

- Strategic timing of deductible expenses
  - "Bunching" deductions, such as medical expenses or charitable donations, into a single tax year to exceed thresholds
  - Prepaying deductible expenses in December rather than January when beneficial

### 2. Tax-Advantaged Accounts

- **Retirement Accounts**
  - Traditional IRA/401(k): Contributions reduce current taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed
  - Roth IRA/401(k): Contributions don't reduce current taxable income, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free

- **Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)**
  - Triple tax advantage: tax-deductible contributions, tax-free growth, tax-free withdrawals for qualified medical expenses

- **Education Savings Plans**
  - 529 Plans: Tax-free growth and withdrawals for qualified education expenses
  - Coverdell Education Savings Accounts: Similar benefits but with lower contribution limits

### 3. Deductions and Credits

- Identifying all eligible deductions and credits
- Comparing standard deduction vs. itemized deductions
- Optimizing charitable giving strategies
- Taking advantage of education-related tax benefits

### 4. Record Keeping

- Maintaining organized documentation
- Digital record-keeping systems
- Receipt management
- Timeline for keeping different types of tax records

## Common Tax Mistakes That Lead to Penalties

- **Missing filing deadlines**
  - Failure-to-file penalty: 5% of unpaid taxes each month, up to 25%
  
- **Underreporting income**
  - 20% accuracy-related penalty for substantial understatement
  - Potential audit and additional penalties
  
- **Claiming ineligible deductions**
  - Repayment of tax benefits plus interest
  - Possible accuracy-related penalties
  
- **Not keeping proper documentation**
  - Burden of proof is on the taxpayer during audits
  - Disallowance of undocumented deductions and credits

## Real-World Examples

### Kate's Approach (Proactive Planning)

- Contributes $6,000 annually to her Roth IRA
- Keeps organized digital records of all tax-related expenses
- Reviews tax implications before making major financial decisions

- **Result**: Maximizes deductions, minimizes tax liability, avoids penalties

### Dave's Approach (Reactive/No Planning)

- No retirement contributions
- Scattered record-keeping with missing receipts

- Files extension, submits taxes in October
- **Result**: Misses deductions, pays higher taxes, incurs late penalties
