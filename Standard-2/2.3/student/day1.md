## Real-World Examples

**Ava's Situation:**
Ava is a high school student who works part-time at a local coffee shop. Last year, she earned $4,500. Although her income is below the filing threshold, her employer withheld federal income tax from each paycheck. Even though Ava isn't required to file a tax return, she should file anyway to get back the money that was withheld.

**Ben's Situation:**
Ben works full-time at a retail store, earning $32,000 annually. He also does freelance graphic design work on the side, which brought in an additional $5,000 last year. Ben must file a tax return because his income exceeds the filing threshold. Additionally, he needs to pay self-employment tax on his freelance income, which covers Social Security and Medicare contributions.

## Activity: Filing Status Impact

3. Taylor is divorced and provides more than half the support for her 10-year-old daughter, who lives with her.
4. Eduardo's wife passed away last year, and he has a 12-year-old son whom he supports.

## Discussion Questions

2. Why might someone want to file taxes even if they're not legally required to do so?
3. How might your tax filing situation change as you go through different stages of life?
