## Detailed Lesson Plan

### 1. Introduction (5 minutes)

- Begin by asking students how many of them have filed taxes before or helped their parents with taxes.
- Emphasize that understanding tax filing is an essential life skill they'll use throughout adulthood.
- Briefly share a personal anecdote about filing taxes for the first time to make the topic relatable.

### 2. Who Needs to File Taxes? (10 minutes)

- Present the concept of filing thresholds using current IRS guidelines.
- Explain how age, income source, and filing status affect filing requirements.
- Emphasize that:
  - Most dependents with earned income over $12,950 (2022) must file
  - Self-employment income over $400 requires filing
  - Some people should file even if not required (to get refunds of withheld taxes)
- Ask students: "Based on what we've discussed, do you think you personally need to file taxes this year? Why or why not?"

### 3. Understanding Tax Forms (10 minutes)

- Show examples of W-2 and 1099 forms, highlighting key sections.
- Explain Form 1040 as the main tax return form and its purpose.
- Point out where to find important information on each form:
  - W-2: Boxes 1 (wages), 2 (federal tax withheld)
  - 1099: Box 1 (non-employee compensation)
  - 1040: Lines for income, deductions, credits
- Discuss why it's important to keep these documents organized and secure.

### 4. Filing Status Breakdown (10 minutes)

- Have students pair up to explore different filing statuses.
- For each status, explain:
  - Eligibility requirements
  - Impact on standard deduction
  - Typical tax benefits
- Cover all five statuses: Single, Married Filing Jointly, Married Filing Separately, Head of Household, Qualifying Widow(er)
- Conduct a quick poll: "Which filing status do you think might apply to you in the next few years?"

### 5. Real-World Examples (10 minutes)

- Present Ava's and Ben's situations from the student content.
- Ask students to identify why Ava should file even though she's below the threshold (to get refund of withheld taxes).
- Have students calculate approximately how much self-employment tax Ben would owe on his $5,000 freelance income (~15.3% or about $765).
- Discuss the concept of estimated tax payments for self-employment income.

### 6. Skill Builder: Tax Documentation Scavenger Hunt (10 minutes)

- Direct students to complete the Tax Documentation Scavenger Hunt activity.
- Remind them to find sample W-2, 1099, and 1040 forms online.
- Encourage them to take screenshots and write brief descriptions of each form.
- This activity can be completed in pairs if preferred.
- Circulate to provide guidance and answer questions.

### 7. Closing Discussion & Homework Assignment (5 minutes)

- Ask students to reflect on when they might need to file taxes for the first time.
- Remind them about the importance of keeping tax documentation organized.
- Homework: Have students complete their Tax Documentation Scavenger Hunt if not finished in class.
- Preview tomorrow's learning lab: "Tomorrow we'll create a decision-making tool to help determine when and how to file taxes."

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Struggling Students:
- Provide printed examples of the tax forms and highlight the most important sections
- Create a simplified filing requirements chart
- Offer a modified scavenger hunt with more guidance

### For Advanced Students:
- Challenge them to research additional tax forms like Schedule C (for business income) or Schedule E (for rental income)
- Ask them to explore state tax filing requirements in addition to federal
- Have them identify tax credits that might benefit young adults

## Assessment Opportunities

### Formative Assessment:
- Monitor student participation in discussions
- Observe paired work on filing statuses
- Review responses to real-world examples

### Summative Assessment:
- Evaluate completed Tax Documentation Scavenger Hunt
- Assess understanding through Day 2 activities

## Common Misconceptions to Address

- "I don't need to file because I don't make much money" - Explain refundable credits that might benefit them.
- "My parents claim me as a dependent so I don't need to file" - Clarify that dependents may still need to file based on their own income.
- "Filing taxes is too complicated for me to understand" - Emphasize that there are many resources available to help.
- "If I can't pay what I owe, I shouldn't file" - Explain that not filing can lead to much larger penalties than filing but not paying immediately.
