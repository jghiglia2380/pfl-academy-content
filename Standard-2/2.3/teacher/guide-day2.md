# Understanding Tax Filing Requirements - Learning Lab Teacher Guide

## Learning Lab Overview

In this Learning Lab, students will apply their knowledge of tax filing requirements by creating a personalized decision tree tool. They will analyze case studies and integrate their learning into their financial literacy portfolio. This hands-on application will reinforce their understanding of when and how to file taxes.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

1. Apply knowledge of tax filing requirements to real-life scenarios
2. Create a decision-making tool for determining when to file taxes
3. Analyze case studies to practice making tax filing decisions
4. Assess their understanding of tax filing requirements

## Preparation

Before class:
- Queue up the podcast recap
- Prepare digital decision tree builder access
- Print case study scenarios
- Have self-assessment questionnaires ready

## Detailed Learning Lab Plan

### 1. Review of Key Concepts (10 minutes)

- Play the pre-recorded podcast recap of Day 1 content.
- After the podcast, conduct a brief Q&A to address any lingering questions.
- Ask targeted questions to ensure students recall:
  - Filing thresholds
  - Different tax forms and their purposes
  - The importance of filing on time
  - How filing status affects tax obligations

### 2. Introduction to Tax Filing Decision Tree (5 minutes)

- Explain the concept of a decision tree and how it can help with tax filing decisions.
- Show an example of a completed decision tree to set expectations.
- Emphasize that their decision trees should include:
  - Starting question (e.g., "How much income did you earn?")
  - Branching paths based on answers
  - Clear endpoints with filing recommendations
- Explain how this tool can be useful throughout their lives as their tax situations change.

### 3. Building a Tax Filing Decision Tree (15 minutes)

- Walk students through the digital decision tree builder tool.
- Guide them in creating branches for:
  - Income thresholds for different filing statuses
  - Special situations (self-employment, investment income)
  - Benefits of filing even when not required
- Help students customize their trees to reflect their personal situations.
- Provide one-on-one guidance as needed.
- Encourage students to include:
  - At least 5 different decision points
  - Clear yes/no questions
  - Specific form recommendations at endpoints
  - Additional resources for complex situations

### 4. Case Study Analysis (15 minutes)

- Present 3-4 diverse tax scenarios for students to analyze using their decision trees.
- Have students determine for each case:
  - Whether the person needs to file
  - What forms they need
  - Which filing status applies
  - Any special considerations
- Suggested case studies:
  1. College student with part-time job earning $8,000, with $500 withheld in taxes
  2. Married couple with one earning $45,000 and one earning $5,000 from freelance work
  3. Single parent with one child, earning $35,000
  4. 17-year-old with summer job earning $3,200 and interest from savings account
- Have students compare their analyses in small groups and discuss any differences in their conclusions.

### 5. Self-Assessment & Portfolio Integration (10 minutes)

- Direct students to complete the self-assessment questionnaire.
- Guide them in adding their tax filing decision tree to their financial literacy portfolio.
- Have them write a brief reflection on how this tool will help them make decisions about tax filing in the future.
- Ask them to identify one specific situation in their lives when they might use their decision tree.

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Struggling Students:
- Provide a partially completed decision tree template
- Offer simplified case studies
- Pair with a stronger student for the case study analysis

### For Advanced Students:
- Include more complex tax scenarios involving multiple income sources or life changes
- Challenge them to incorporate state tax filing requirements
- Have them research and add information about tax credits and deductions

## Assessment Opportunities

### Formative Assessment:
- Observe students' progress as they build their decision trees
- Listen for accurate application of concepts during case study analysis
- Monitor group discussions for understanding

### Summative Assessment:
- Evaluate completed decision trees for accuracy and comprehensiveness
- Review self-assessment questionnaires
- Assess portfolio reflections

## Common Challenges

- Students may struggle with the technical aspects of creating a decision tree. Be prepared to provide technical support.
- Some students might find tax concepts abstract if they haven't worked yet. Use relatable examples to make concepts more concrete.
- Decision trees may become overly complex. Encourage students to focus on the most common scenarios first.

## Extension Opportunities

- Invite students who finish early to create additional branches for their decision trees covering more complex tax situations.
- Challenge advanced students to research and add information about state tax filing requirements.
- Have students create a "Tax Filing FAQ" resource to accompany their decision trees.
