## Detailed Lesson Plan

### Podcast Review (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Refresh key concepts from Day 1

- Play the pre-recorded podcast that reviews:
    - Progressive vs. regressive taxation
    - Federal income tax brackets
    - State tax variations
    - Payroll taxes
- After listening, clarify any questions students have about the concepts

**Teaching Tip:** While the podcast plays, observe which students seem engaged vs. confused to identify who might need additional support.

### Tax Impact Calculator Introduction (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Orient students to the calculator tool

- Demonstrate the Tax Impact Calculator using a sample income scenario
- Explain how to:
    - Enter different income levels
    - Select different states
    - Interpret the results showing federal, state, and FICA taxes
    - Compare take-home pay across scenarios

**Teaching Tip:** Emphasize that this calculator provides estimates and that actual tax situations would include additional factors like deductions and credits.

### Tax Impact Calculator Activity (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Apply calculator to analyze various tax scenarios

- Have students use the calculator to:
    - Compare take-home pay at their expected starting salary in their home state vs. two other states
    - Analyze how the tax burden changes as income increases
    - Determine which states would provide the highest take-home pay at different income levels
- Students should record their findings in the digital worksheet

**Teaching Tip:** Circulate to assist students who are struggling with the calculator and to challenge advanced students to interpret results more deeply.

### State Tax Comparison Project (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Research and compare comprehensive tax structures

- Guide students to select three states to research:
    - One with no state income tax
    - One with a flat tax rate
    - One with progressive tax brackets
- Students should research and record:
    - Income tax rates and structure
    - Average property tax rates
    - State and local sales tax rates
    - Any unique taxes or fees
- Emphasize the importance of considering the complete tax picture, not just income taxes

**Teaching Tip:** Provide reliable resources for state tax information, such as state government websites or the Tax Foundation.

### Tax Planning Scenario (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Apply tax knowledge to a realistic decision-making scenario

- Present the scenario: "You've been offered the same job in two different states with significantly different tax structures."
- Have students use their research and calculator results to:
    - Determine their take-home pay in each location
    - Consider other tax impacts beyond income tax
    - Evaluate non-tax factors that might influence their decision
    - Make and justify a recommendation

**Teaching Tip:** Remind students that while tax considerations are important, other factors like cost of living, quality of life, and career opportunities also matter in location decisions.

### Portfolio Building and Reflection (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Synthesize learning and create a personal tax strategy

- Guide students to create their personal tax strategy by:
    - Summarizing what they learned about tax impacts
    - Identifying strategies to maximize take-home pay
    - Considering how taxes will affect their budgeting
    - Planning for tax considerations in future career decisions
- Encourage students to be specific about how this knowledge will influence their financial decisions

**Teaching Tip:** This is a good opportunity to connect tax planning to other financial literacy topics like budgeting and saving.

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Struggling Students
- Focus on the basic tax calculator scenarios and provide additional guidance on the state research.
- Offer a simplified template for the state tax comparison with key information already filled in.
- Pair students who need additional support with peers who can assist them.

### For Advanced Students
- Challenge them to incorporate tax deductions and credits into their analysis and to consider more complex scenarios like self-employment taxes.
- Ask them to analyze how changes in tax policy might affect different income levels and demographics.
- Have them research and explain tax-advantaged investment options and their long-term impact.

## Assessment Opportunities
- **Formative:** Monitor student use of the tax calculator and interpretation of results
- **Product-Based:** Evaluate state tax comparison research for accuracy and comprehensiveness
- **Reflection-Based:** Assess personal tax strategy for depth of understanding and practical application

## Connections to Prior and Future Learning
- **Prior Learning Connection:** Link to previous lessons on budgeting by emphasizing that tax planning is essential for accurate budget creation.
- **Future Learning Connection:** Preview upcoming lessons on retirement planning by noting the connection to Social Security and Medicare taxes.
