# Understanding Federal and State Taxes - Day 2 Learning Lab

## OVERVIEW

In today's Learning Lab, you'll apply what you learned about taxes by creating a take-home pay calculator, analyzing tax impacts across states, and developing strategies for tax planning.

## WARM-UP: PODCAST RECAP

Listen to the podcast recap of key concepts from yesterday's lesson on federal and state taxes.

## TAX IMPACT CALCULATOR

Use the interactive calculator to determine how different tax scenarios affect take-home pay. Enter various income levels and state choices to see the resulting differences in net income.

## STATE TAX COMPARISON PROJECT

Choose three states to research and compare:

- One with no state income tax
- One with a flat tax rate
- One with progressive tax brackets

For each state, analyze the complete tax picture including income, sales, and property taxes.

## TAX PLANNING SCENARIO

You've been offered the same job in two different states with significantly different tax structures. Using the data from your research, determine which location would be more financially advantageous based on your projected income and spending habits.

## PORTFOLIO BUILDING: MY TAX STRATEGY

Based on your research and the tax impact calculator results, develop a personal tax strategy that considers:

- Your career goals and projected income path
- Geographic preferences for where you might want to live
- Tax planning strategies to maximize your take-home pay
- How you'll account for taxes in your monthly and annual budget

## REFLECTION

Reflect on how your understanding of taxes has evolved and how this knowledge will influence your financial decisions moving forward.
