## LESSON ACTIVITIES

### INTRODUCTION: WHERE DOES THE MONEY COME FROM?

Think about the services you use daily—schools, roads, healthcare, police—how do you think these are funded? Where does the money come from?

### EXPLORING FEDERAL INCOME TAX

Federal income tax is based on a progressive tax system, meaning tax rates increase as your income increases. Let's examine how federal tax brackets work and what that means for your take-home pay.

### STATE INCOME TAX COMPARISON

Each state has its own tax system. Some states like Texas and Florida have no state income tax, while others like California have higher income tax rates. Would you prefer to live in a state with no income tax but higher property and sales taxes, or a state with income tax but potentially lower other taxes?

### PAYROLL TAXES AND YOUR PAYCHECK

Beyond income taxes, every employee pays payroll taxes (FICA) to fund Social Security and Medicare. These taxes are automatically deducted from your paycheck. Let's analyze a sample pay stub to understand all the deductions that affect your net income.

### CASE STUDY ANALYSIS

Compare the financial situations of individuals living in different states with varying tax structures:

- Mia in California (with state income tax)
- Liam in Texas (no state income tax)

What are the advantages and disadvantages of each situation?

## SKILL BUILDER ACTIVITY: TAX SYSTEM ANALYSIS

### DIRECTIONS

For each scenario below, decide whether a progressive tax system or a regressive tax system would be more appropriate. Consider each person's ability to pay, the impact on their financial situation, and the potential benefits received.

**Progressive Tax System:** A system where higher-income individuals pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes.

**Regressive Tax System:** A system where lower-income individuals pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes compared to higher-income individuals.
