## Detailed Lesson Plan

### Introduction and Review (10 min)
- Play pre-recorded podcast reviewing key concepts from Day 1:
  - Progressive tax system basics
  - Marginal vs. effective tax rates
  - Tax brackets and calculations
  - Tax avoidance vs. tax evasion
- After listening, facilitate a brief Q&A session to address any lingering questions
- Ask students to recall the key difference between marginal and effective tax rates
- Review the distinction between legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion
- Connect Day 1 content to today's exploration of tax ethics and policy

### Tax Ethics Research Challenge (15 min)
- Divide students into small groups (3-4 students)
- Assign each group a tax policy or strategy to research from the following options:
  - Corporate tax inversions
  - Charitable giving tax incentives
  - Capital gains tax preferences
  - State tax competition
  - International tax havens
  - Mortgage interest deduction
- Provide each group with research resources (digital or printed)
- Students research their topic and analyze:
  - Who benefits from this policy/strategy?
  - Who might be disadvantaged?
  - What are the broader societal impacts?
  - Is this policy/strategy primarily about fairness or economic growth?
- Monitor groups during research to provide guidance and keep them on track
- Have each group prepare a brief (1-2 minute) summary of their findings

### Tax Impact Analysis (10 min)
- Demonstrate the interactive tax impact calculator
- Explain the various inputs and outputs of the tool
- Have students use the calculator to:
  - Compare tax burdens across income levels
  - Examine how different deductions affect tax liability
  - Analyze how various tax strategies change effective tax rates
  - Explore the impact of different filing statuses
- Ask students to document their findings and observations
- Guide students to notice patterns in how different tax systems distribute tax burden
- Facilitate a brief sharing of key insights from their analysis

### Tax Policy Proposal (10 min)
- Based on their research and analysis, have students develop a brief policy proposal:
  - Identify a specific issue with the current tax system
  - Propose a solution or reform
  - Explain how their proposal balances fairness and economic considerations
  - Address potential objections to their proposal
- Remind students that effective policy proposals must:
  - Be specific and actionable
  - Consider both intended and unintended consequences
  - Balance multiple stakeholder interests
  - Be fiscally realistic
- Allow a few volunteers to share their proposals with the class
- Encourage respectful peer feedback on the proposals

### Tax Ethics Position Statement and Reflection (10 min)
- Explain the components of a strong position statement
- Students develop a position statement on tax ethics that:
  - Articulates their view on the balance between legal tax minimization and ethical tax responsibility
  - References specific examples from their research
  - Connects to their Day 1 Skill Builder responses
  - Explains how their understanding has evolved
- Provide a structured template for the position statement
- Encourage students to consider multiple perspectives
- Remind students that well-reasoned positions acknowledge trade-offs and complexities

### Portfolio Integration and Closing Discussion (2 min)
- Students compile their research, analysis, proposal, and position statement
- Guide students on how to organize these materials in their financial literacy portfolio
- Facilitate a brief closing discussion:
  - What were the most surprising things you learned about taxation?
  - How has your understanding of taxes changed?
  - How might this knowledge influence your financial decisions?
- Preview how this connects to upcoming lessons on budgeting with taxes in mind

## Assessment Strategies
- Evaluate research quality and depth of analysis in the Tax Ethics Research Challenge
- Assess policy proposals for practicality, reasoning, and evidence base
- Review position statements for logical consistency and evidence-based reasoning
- Monitor group participation and individual contributions during activities
- Check for application of Day 1 concepts in Day 2 activities

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Struggling Students
- Provide structured templates for research, policy proposals, and position statements
- Offer simplified tax policy topics with more accessible resources
- Create scaffolded worksheets for the tax impact analysis
- Pair students who need additional support with peer mentors
- Provide visual organizers for organizing thoughts and research findings

### For Advanced Students
- Encourage research on more complex tax policies or international comparisons
- Challenge students to model economic impacts of their policy proposals
- Ask them to develop counterarguments to their own positions
- Suggest incorporating historical tax policy evolution in their analysis
- Have them evaluate real-world tax reform proposals from various stakeholders

## Extension Opportunities
- Compare international tax systems and their societal impacts
- Research historical changes in U.S. tax policy and their effects
- Analyze how taxes fund specific government programs and services
- Explore the relationship between taxation and wealth distribution
- Debate current tax reform proposals and their potential impacts
