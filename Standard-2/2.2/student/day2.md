# Understanding Tax Brackets and Tax Rates - Learning Lab

## OVERVIEW

Today we'll build upon our understanding of tax brackets and explore deeper ethical and practical considerations around taxation. You'll analyze real-world tax strategies, evaluate their impact on society, and develop your own position on tax policy.

## KEY CONCEPTS REVIEW

- Progressive tax system
- Marginal vs. effective tax rates
- Tax avoidance vs. tax evasion
- Tax brackets and how they work

## TAX ETHICS RESEARCH CHALLENGE

Working individually or in small groups, you'll research a specific tax policy or strategy and analyze its societal impact. Some potential topics include:

- Corporate tax inversions

For your chosen topic, investigate:
- How the policy/strategy works
- Who benefits and who may be disadvantaged

## TAX IMPACT ANALYSIS

Use the interactive calculator to explore how different tax strategies impact individuals and businesses across income levels. The calculator allows you to:

- Compare tax burdens across different income brackets
- Model changes to standard deductions and credits
- Visualize the difference between progressive and flat tax systems
- Calculate effective tax rates under different scenarios

For each scenario, record:
- The tax liability for each income level
- The effective tax rate
- The percentage of total tax revenue contributed by each income group
- How changes to one part of the tax code affect different taxpayers
