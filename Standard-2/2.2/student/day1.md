# Understanding Tax Brackets and Tax Rates

## OVERVIEW

In this lesson, you'll explore how tax brackets affect your income. You'll learn the difference between marginal and effective tax rates and how our progressive tax system works. By understanding how taxes are calculated, you'll be better prepared to make informed financial decisions throughout your life.

## KEY CONCEPTS

- **Tax Bracket**: Income ranges that are taxed at different rates
- **Marginal Tax Rate**: The rate at which your last dollar of income is taxed
- **Effective Tax Rate**: The average rate at which all your income is taxed
- **Progressive Tax System**: A system where tax rates increase as income increases
- **Tax Liability**: The total amount of tax you owe
- **Withholding**: Taxes deducted from your paycheck before you receive it
- **Filing Status**: Categories like single, married filing jointly, or head of household that affect your tax rate
- **Taxable Income**: Your income after deductions that is subject to tax

## REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES

### Jared's Situation

Jared is single and earns $50,000 per year. Under the current tax system:

- The first $11,000 is taxed at 10% = $1,100
- The next $33,725 is taxed at 12% = $4,047
- The remaining $5,275 is taxed at 22% = $1,160
- Total tax: $6,307

**Marginal Tax Rate**: 22% (the rate on his highest dollar of income)
**Effective Tax Rate**: 12.6% ($6,307 ÷ $50,000)

### Sara's Situation

Sara and her spouse have a combined income of $110,000. Filing jointly:

- The first $22,000 is taxed at 10% = $2,200
- The next $67,450 is taxed at 12% = $8,094
- The remaining $20,550 is taxed at 22% = $4,521
- Total tax: $14,815

**Marginal Tax Rate**: 22%
**Effective Tax Rate**: 13.5% ($14,815 ÷ $110,000)

## GROUP ACTIVITY: TAX CALCULATION EXERCISE

Working with your group, calculate the taxes owed for your assigned income level using the current tax brackets. Determine both the marginal and effective tax rates.

## RECENT GRADUATE CASE STUDY

A student graduates and earns a starting salary of $55,000. Calculate:

1. How much tax they will pay in each bracket
2. Their total tax liability
3. Their marginal tax rate
4. Their effective tax rate
5. How this affects their monthly take-home pay

## FILING STATUS DISCUSSION

Different filing statuses (single, married filing jointly, head of household) impact which tax brackets apply to you. Consider how your future family situation might affect your tax liability.

## SKILL BUILDER: UNDERSTANDING TAX EVASION AND TAX AVOIDANCE

### Example 1: Illegal Tax Evasion – Al Capone's Downfall

Al Capone, one of the most notorious crime bosses in U.S. history, was brought down not by his criminal activities but through tax evasion charges. Despite running a lucrative empire through illegal alcohol distribution, gambling, and other illicit businesses, Capone failed to report his income to the IRS. The government's investigation revealed substantial earnings that were not accounted for in tax filings, allowing the prosecution to charge him with tax evasion. In 1931, Capone was convicted and sentenced to 11 years in federal prison. This case illustrates how failing to report income, regardless of its source, can lead to severe legal consequences, including hefty fines and imprisonment. Tax evasion, in this context, is considered a criminal act because it involves willfully hiding income or falsifying records to avoid paying taxes.

**What do you think**: Why do you think the government prioritized prosecuting Al Capone for tax evasion instead of his other criminal activities? What does this say about the importance of tax compliance in maintaining legal and financial order?

### Example 2: Legal Tax Avoidance – Amazon's Global Strategy

Amazon is a prime example of how large corporations legally reduce their tax liabilities through strategic financial planning. In 2021, Amazon reported a federal tax rate of just 6 percent on its U.S. profits of over $35 billion, saving approximately $5.2 billion in federal corporate taxes by using various tax credits and deductions.

One common tactic employed by Amazon is setting up subsidiaries and moving profits to countries with lower tax rates, such as Luxembourg, allowing them to minimize their U.S. tax obligations.

Additionally, Amazon leverages stock options and foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) deductions to further decrease its tax burden. Although this approach is currently legal, the federal government and international bodies have been scrutinizing these strategies, with efforts underway to impose minimum corporate tax provisions that could limit such tax avoidance tactics.

This scenario demonstrates the fine line between legal tax avoidance and tax evasion, where the former takes advantage of legal loopholes to minimize tax bills, while the latter involves illegally concealing income.

**What do you think**: Do you believe it is ethical for corporations like Amazon to use legal loopholes to avoid paying taxes? How do you think this impacts society, and what changes, if any, would you suggest to make corporate tax policies fairer?

## REFLECTION

Reflect on your current or projected income level. How does understanding your tax bracket and the differences between marginal and effective tax rates influence your budgeting and financial planning strategies?
