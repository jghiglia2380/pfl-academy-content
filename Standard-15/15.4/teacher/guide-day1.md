## Timeline
### Introduction (5 minutes)
- Briefly introduce the importance of interview skills in the job search process
- Preview the day's activities and learning objectives

### Key Elements of a Successful Interview (15 minutes)

- Discuss the importance of researching the company and role beforehand
- Emphasize the role of nonverbal communication (e.g., eye contact, posture, attire)
- Highlight the significance of asking thoughtful questions at the end of the interview

#### Discussion Prompts
- What do you think is the most important element of a successful interview? Why?
  * Example response: Demonstrating how your skills and experiences align with the role and company, because it shows you're a strong fit.
- How can you prepare to answer common interview questions effectively?
  * Example response: Practice using the STAR method to structure your responses with specific examples.

### Skill Builder: Mock Interviews (25 minutes)
- Divide students into pairs
- Provide a list of common interview questions for students to ask each other
- Have students take turns playing the role of interviewer and interviewee
- Encourage students to provide constructive feedback on their partner's responses and nonverbal communication

#### Differentiation Strategies
- For students needing additional support:
  * Provide sentence starters or templates for using the STAR method
  * Allow them to reference notes during the mock interview
- For students needing additional challenge:
  * Assign more complex behavioral questions
  * Challenge them to improvise responses without preparation

### Reflection and Assessment (10 minutes)
- Have students complete a self-assessment of their interview skills based on the mock interviews
- Facilitate a brief whole-class discussion on key takeaways and areas for improvement

#### Formative Assessment
- Circulate during mock interviews to assess student understanding and provide real-time feedback

#### Summative Assessment
- Collect and review student self-assessments to gauge mastery of learning objectives

## Common Misconceptions
- Misconception: The interviewer is trying to trick you with difficult questions.
  * Address this by emphasizing that the interviewer's goal is to assess your fit for the role, not to stump you. Encourage students to view questions as opportunities to showcase their strengths.
- Misconception: Nonverbal communication doesn't matter as much as what you say.
  * Highlight research showing that nonverbal cues can be even more influential than verbal responses. Stress the importance of projecting confidence and professionalism through body language.
