### Timeline (55-minute class)
- Introduction and Station Setup (5 minutes)
- Station Rotation 1 (15 minutes)
- Station Rotation 2 (15 minutes)
- Station Rotation 3 (15 minutes)
- Closing Reflection (5 minutes)

### Instruction Notes
#### Introduction and Station Setup (5 minutes)
- Briefly review key concepts from Day 1 lesson on job applications.
- Explain the station rotation format and expectations for group work.
- Divide students into groups and assign initial stations.

#### Station Rotation 1-3 (15 minutes each)
- Students rotate through three stations focusing on different aspects of the job application process:
  1. Error Identification: Students review sample job applications and identify errors or areas for improvement.
  2. Peer Review: Students work in pairs to review and provide feedback on each other's job application drafts.
  3. Mock Interviews: Students participate in mock interviews, taking turns as the interviewer and interviewee.
- Circulate among stations to monitor progress, provide guidance, and ensure active participation.

### Discussion Prompts
- What are some common mistakes you noticed in the sample job applications?
  * Example: Incomplete or inaccurate information, typos, lack of proofreading
- How can you provide constructive feedback to your peers during the review process?
  * Example: Focus on specific areas for improvement, provide concrete suggestions, use a respectful tone
- What strategies can you use to feel more confident during a job interview?
  * Example: Practice common questions, research the company, prepare relevant examples of your skills and experience

### Differentiation Strategies
#### Students who need additional support:
- Provide a checklist of key elements to review in job applications.
- Offer extra guidance during peer review and mock interviews.
- Allow students to reference notes or job application templates.

#### Students who need additional challenge:
- Encourage students to identify less obvious errors in sample applications.
- Challenge students to provide more detailed and specific feedback during peer review.
- Assign students to role-play more complex interview scenarios.

### Assessment Opportunities
- Formative: Observe student participation and progress during station rotations.
- Summative: Collect and evaluate students' revised job application drafts.

### Common Misconceptions
- Misconception: A job application is not as important as a resume.
  * Address by emphasizing the critical role applications play in the hiring process and how they provide additional information not found in a resume.
- Misconception: It's okay to leave some sections of the application blank.
  * Address by stressing the importance of completing all required fields and providing thorough responses to demonstrate attention to detail.

### Closing Reflection (5 minutes)
- Prompt students to reflect on their key takeaways from the learning stations.
- Encourage students to set personal goals for improving their job application skills.
- Preview upcoming lessons on related topics, such as resume writing and interview preparation.
