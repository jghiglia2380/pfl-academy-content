   - Strength of your value proposition
   - Appeal of your business name
   - Potential challenges or opportunities you may have missed

   - What frustrations do they have with current solutions?
   - How valuable would your solution be to them?
   - What would they be willing to pay?

4. Role-play customer interviews with classmates, gathering feedback on your business concept.
