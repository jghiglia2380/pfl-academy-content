## Introduction to Resume Building

A resume is often your first introduction to potential employers—it's your personal marketing document. An effective resume should be clear, concise, and tailored to the position you're seeking. Most importantly, it should quickly communicate your value to employers.

### The Purpose of a Resume

Your resume serves several important functions:
- Presents your qualifications, skills, and experiences in a structured format
- Demonstrates your fit for a specific position or industry
- Shows your ability to communicate professionally
- Gets you an interview where you can elaborate on your qualifications

While resumes have evolved over time, their core purpose remains the same: to help you stand out from other candidates and secure opportunities that align with your career goals.

A strong resume typically includes these essential sections:

### 1. Contact Information
- Full name (slightly larger than the rest of the text)
- Phone number
- Professional email address
- Location (city and state)
- Optional: LinkedIn profile or professional website

### 2. Professional Summary or Objective
- 2-4 sentence overview of your key qualifications
- Tailored to the specific position
- Highlights your unique value proposition
- For example: "Detail-oriented marketing professional with 3 years of experience in social media management and content creation. Skilled in developing engaging campaigns that increased user engagement by 35% for previous employers. Seeking to leverage creative problem-solving skills in a growth-oriented marketing role."

### 3. Education

## Resume Best Practices

### Use Strong Action Verbs
Begin each bullet point with an action verb to demonstrate your contributions proactively:

- **Analysis**: Analyzed, Evaluated, Researched, Assessed

### Quantify Achievements
Numbers make your accomplishments more concrete and impressive:

- "Managed a $15,000 budget for student organization events"
- "Trained 12 new team members on company procedures"

### Keep It Concise
- Most entry-level resumes should be one page
- Use bullet points rather than paragraphs
- Include only relevant information
- Be selective—quality over quantity

### Format Consistently
- Use the same font style and size throughout
- Maintain consistent spacing and alignment
- Use bold, italics, and underlining sparingly and consistently
- Make sure the document is easy to scan quickly

### Tailor to Each Opportunity
- Research the job description and company
- Highlight skills and experiences most relevant to the position
- Mirror key terms from the job description
- Adjust your professional summary for each application

## Introduction to Personal Branding

Your personal brand is how you present yourself professionally to the world. It encompasses your skills, experiences, personality, and values—all the things that make you uniquely qualified for your career path.

### Why Personal Branding Matters

A strong personal brand:
- Helps you stand out in a competitive job market
- Creates recognition and memorability with employers
