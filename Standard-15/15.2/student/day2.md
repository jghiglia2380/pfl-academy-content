Make note of any areas where you feel your resume could be strengthened.

## Common Resume Mistakes to Avoid

Before we begin peer review, let's examine some common resume mistakes that can diminish your chances of landing an interview:

### 1. Typos and Grammatical Errors
- Even small errors can suggest carelessness to employers
- Always proofread carefully and have others review your resume
- Use spelling and grammar checking tools, but don't rely on them exclusively

- Inconsistent fonts, spacing, bullet styles, or date formats
- Irregular alignment or indentation
- Inconsistent use of bold, italics, or capitalization

- Generic descriptions without specific examples
- Overused phrases like "team player" or "hard worker" without supporting evidence
- Lack of action verbs or quantifiable achievements

- Excessive white space or too little information
- Including irrelevant details that don't add value

### 5. Missing or Inappropriate Contact Information
