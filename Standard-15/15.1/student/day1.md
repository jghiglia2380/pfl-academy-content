*Discussion Question*: Think about the adults in your life. Do they have jobs, careers, or both? What factors might influence whether someone pursues a job or a career?

## Self-Assessment: Discovering Your Path

Before exploring specific careers, it's important to understand yourselfâ€”your interests, skills, values, and personality traits.

### Interests Assessment

Consider the following questions:
- What subjects do you enjoy studying?
- What activities do you lose track of time doing?
- What topics do you enjoy reading or learning about?
- What types of problems do you enjoy solving?

### Skills Inventory

Skills can be divided into two main categories:

**Hard Skills**: Technical, teachable abilities that are specific to certain jobs
- Computer programming
- Data analysis
- Operating machinery
- Foreign language proficiency
- Writing or editing

**Soft Skills**: Personal attributes that help you work effectively with others
- Communication
- Leadership
- Problem-solving
- Time management
- Teamwork
- Adaptability

Take a few minutes to list 5-7 of your strongest hard skills and soft skills.

### Values Clarification

Your work values are the aspects of a job or career that are most important to you. Consider which of these work values resonate with you:

- Work-life balance
- Creativity and innovation
- Leadership opportunities
- Financial security
- Making a difference in society
- Independence and autonomy
- Recognition and prestige
- Intellectual stimulation
- Variety and change
- Stability and security

*Activity*: Rank your top five work values in order of importance to you.

## SMART Career Goals

Setting clear, well-defined goals is essential for career planning. SMART goals help ensure your objectives are achievable and measurable:

### S - Specific
Your goal should answer the questions: What exactly do I want to accomplish? Why is this goal important? Who is involved?

*Example*: "I want to become a certified nursing assistant" is more specific than "I want to work in healthcare."

### M - Measurable
Your goal should include criteria to track progress and determine when you've achieved it.

*Example*: "I will complete a certification program and pass the state exam" provides measurable milestones.

### A - Achievable
Your goal should be realistic and attainable given your current situation and resources.

*Example*: An achievable goal considers your current education level, financial resources, and time constraints.

### R - Relevant
Your goal should align with your broader career aspirations and personal values.

*Example*: If helping others is important to you, a healthcare career goal is relevant to your values.

### T - Time-bound
Your goal should include a target date for completion.

*Example*: "I will complete my certification within 12 months" provides a clear timeframe.

*Activity*: Write one SMART career goal that you would like to achieve. It can be a short-term goal (next 1-2 years) or a long-term goal (3+ years).

## Career Development Plan

A career development plan outlines the steps needed to reach your career goals. It typically includes:

### 1. Career Objective

### 6. Timeline and Milestones
