# 13.1: Strategies for Managing High Levels of Debt - Learning Lab

## Overview

In this Learning Lab, students will apply their knowledge of debt management strategies through interactive activities designed to develop practical skills for managing high levels of debt. Through real-world simulations, case studies, and collaborative exercises, students will explore debt management plans, debt consolidation, bankruptcy alternatives, and credit rebuilding strategies.

## Warm-Up: Debt Management Scenario Review

Let's begin by reviewing what we learned about debt management strategies. Think about the following scenarios and identify which debt management approach might be most appropriate:

1. A recent college graduate with $5,000 in credit card debt spread across four cards, all with high interest rates, who just started a stable job.
2. A family with $75,000 in medical debt from an emergency surgery, struggling to make minimum payments while managing everyday expenses.
3. A small business owner with $120,000 in business debt who has experienced a significant reduction in income and can no longer keep up with payments.

Discuss with a partner which debt management strategy (debt management plan, debt consolidation, debt settlement, or bankruptcy) might be most appropriate for each scenario and why.

## Activity 1: Debt Reduction Planning Workshop

In this activity, you'll work in small groups to create comprehensive debt reduction plans for different scenarios.

### Instructions:

1. Your group will receive a detailed case study of an individual or family facing high levels of debt.
2. Analyze the financial situation, including:
   - Types and amounts of debt
   - Income and expenses
   - Assets available
   - Credit score and history
   - Personal goals and priorities

3. Create a step-by-step debt reduction plan that includes:
   - Prioritization of debts (which to pay first)
   - Budget adjustments to increase debt payment capacity
   - Specific debt management strategies to implement
   - Timeline for becoming debt-free
   - Contingency plans for potential setbacks

4. Prepare to present your plan to the class, explaining your reasoning and how your approach addresses the specific circumstances of your case.

> **Discussion Prompt**: How did your group decide which debts to prioritize first? What factors influenced this decision?

## Activity 2: Debt Consolidation Calculator

In this hands-on activity, you will use a debt consolidation calculator to analyze when consolidation makes financial sense.

### Instructions:

1. Access the Debt Consolidation Calculator tool.
2. Input the following information for the provided scenario:
   - Current debts (amounts, interest rates, minimum payments)
   - Potential consolidation loan terms (interest rate, loan period, fees)
   - Monthly budget constraints

3. Compare the results, analyzing:
   - Total interest paid under each scenario
   - Monthly payment differences
   - Time to debt-free status
   - Impact on cash flow and budget flexibility

4. Document your findings and recommendations in your portfolio.

## Activity 3: Bankruptcy Alternatives Analysis

This activity focuses on exploring and evaluating alternatives to bankruptcy through a collaborative research project.

### Instructions:

1. Form teams of 3-4 students.
2. Each team will be assigned one alternative to bankruptcy:
   - Team 1: Credit counseling and debt management plans
   - Team 2: Debt settlement and negotiation
   - Team 3: Debt consolidation strategies
   - Team 4: Income increase and expense reduction methods

3. Research your assigned alternative, focusing on:
   - How the process works
   - Pros and cons
   - Who it works best for
   - Potential long-term impacts
   - Reputable resources and organizations

4. Create a visual presentation (poster, digital slides, or infographic) that clearly explains your alternative.
5. Present your findings to the class, providing specific examples and case studies where this alternative was successful.

> **Case Study**: The Rodriguez family has $85,000 in debt: $15,000 in credit card debt, a $45,000 auto loan, and $25,000 in medical bills. Their monthly income is $5,500, and their minimum debt payments total $1,800 per month. They're considering bankruptcy but want to explore alternatives first. Which approach would you recommend, and why?

## Activity 4: Credit Rebuilding Simulation

In this interactive simulation, you'll experience the process of rebuilding credit after a significant financial setback.

### Instructions:

1. You'll start the simulation with a credit score of 520 following a major debt event.
2. Each round represents 6 months of financial decisions.
3. You'll be presented with various choices related to:
   - Credit applications
   - Payment history
   - Debt utilization
   - Savings and emergency funds
   - Income opportunities

4. After each decision point, you'll see how your choices impact your credit score and financial situation.
5. The goal is to rebuild your credit score to at least 680 within the simulated timeframe.
6. Keep a journal of your decisions and their outcomes, reflecting on what worked and what didn't.

## Portfolio Project: Comprehensive Debt Management Guide

For your portfolio project, you will create a comprehensive guide for managing high levels of debt that demonstrates your understanding of the various strategies and their applications.

### Instructions:

1. Create a debt management guide that includes:
   - An introduction explaining the impact of high debt levels
   - A comparison chart of different debt management strategies
   - Decision flowchart to help determine which strategy is most appropriate for different situations
   - Step-by-step instructions for implementing each strategy
   - Resources and organizations that can provide assistance
   - Strategies for rebuilding credit after debt resolution

2. Your guide should be well-organized, visually appealing, and accessible to people with different levels of financial knowledge.

3. Include at least three detailed case studies that illustrate how different approaches might work for different financial situations.

4. Document the research you conducted to create your guide, citing at least five reputable sources.

## Reflection

Think about what you've learned regarding strategies for managing high levels of debt. Answer the following questions:

1. Which debt management strategy do you believe is most effective for someone with primarily credit card debt? Why?

2. What are the most important factors to consider when deciding between debt settlement and bankruptcy?

3. If you were helping a friend or family member who was struggling with overwhelming debt, what advice would you give them about seeking professional help?

4. What did you find most surprising about the process of rebuilding credit after a major financial setback?

## Learning Lab Summary

In this Learning Lab, you've explored practical applications of debt management strategies through interactive activities and simulations. You've analyzed different approaches to managing high levels of debt, evaluated bankruptcy alternatives, and developed skills for creating effective debt reduction plans. These practical skills will help you make informed financial decisions and provide guidance to others who may be facing debt challenges.

Remember that managing debt effectively requires a personalized approach based on individual circumstances, and that with patience and discipline, it's possible to overcome even significant financial setbacks and rebuild credit over time.
