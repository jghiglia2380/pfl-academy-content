## Detailed Learning Lab Plan

### Warm-Up: Debt Management Scenario Review (5 minutes)

Begin the Learning Lab by reviewing the debt management strategies learned in Day 1 through practical scenarios.

**Facilitation approach:**
1. Present the three scenarios from the student content:
   - Recent college graduate with $5,000 in credit card debt
   - Family with $75,000 in medical debt
   - Small business owner with $120,000 in business debt
2. Have students discuss with a partner which debt management strategy would be most appropriate for each scenario
3. After 3 minutes of discussion, ask volunteers to share their recommendations and reasoning
4. Highlight thoughtful analyses that consider multiple factors, not just debt amount

**Key discussion points to emphasize:**
- The importance of considering income stability when choosing a strategy
- How different types of debt may require different approaches
- The role of credit score in determining available options
- The need to balance immediate relief with long-term consequences

### Activity 1: Debt Reduction Planning Workshop (15 minutes)

In this activity, students work in small groups to create comprehensive debt reduction plans for detailed case studies.

**Facilitation approach:**
1. Divide students into groups of 3-4
2. Distribute a different case study to each group (prepare 4-5 distinct scenarios)
3. Explain the components of a complete debt reduction plan
4. Provide a structured worksheet for groups to record their analysis and recommendations
5. Circulate to provide guidance and ask probing questions

**Sample case studies to include:**
- A family with medical debt, credit card debt, and a mortgage who recently experienced job loss
- A recent graduate with student loans, auto loan, and credit card debt starting a new job
- A couple nearing retirement with significant credit card debt and insufficient retirement savings
- A single parent with payday loans, medical debt, and past-due utility bills

**Guiding questions for groups:**
- "What is the most urgent debt issue in your scenario?"
- "How would you prioritize which debts to pay first?"
- "What specific debt management strategy would you recommend and why?"
- "What budget adjustments could increase debt payment capacity?"
- "What is a realistic timeline for becoming debt-free?"

### Group Sharing (10 minutes)

Have groups briefly present their debt reduction plans to the class.

**Facilitation approach:**
1. Allow each group 1-2 minutes to summarize their scenario and plan
2. After each presentation, invite one question or suggestion from another group
3. Highlight effective strategies and creative solutions
4. Note common themes across different scenarios

**Key points to emphasize:**
- The importance of tailoring strategies to specific circumstances
- How prioritization of debts affects the overall success of a plan
- The value of contingency planning for potential setbacks
- Balance between aggressive debt repayment and maintaining quality of life

### Activity 2: Debt Consolidation Calculator (15 minutes)

Students use debt consolidation calculators to evaluate when consolidation makes financial sense.

**Facilitation approach:**
1. Direct students to the appropriate online calculator (provide options or a specific tool)
2. Provide a structured scenario with detailed debt information
3. Guide students through the initial inputs for the calculation
4. Have students work independently to complete the analysis
5. Prompt students to document their findings and recommendations

**Sample scenario details to provide:**
- Current debts: 3 credit cards ($3,000 at 22%, $5,000 at 18%, $2,500 at 24%)
- Auto loan: $12,000 at 7.5% interest
- Potential consolidation options:
  - Personal loan at 10.5% for 5 years with 2% origination fee
  - Home equity loan at 7% for 10 years with $500 in closing costs
  - Balance transfer card at 0% for 18 months, then 16%, with 3% transfer fee

**Analysis prompts for students:**
- "Calculate the total interest paid under each option"
- "Determine the monthly payment differences"
- "Analyze how long it would take to become debt-free under each scenario"
- "Evaluate which option provides the best balance of monthly payment reduction and total interest savings"
- "Consider non-financial factors that might influence the decision"

### Activity 3: Bankruptcy Alternatives Analysis (15 minutes)

Students work in teams to research and evaluate alternatives to bankruptcy.

**Facilitation approach:**
1. Assign teams to one of the four bankruptcy alternatives:
   - Credit counseling and debt management plans
   - Debt settlement and negotiation
   - Debt consolidation strategies
   - Income increase and expense reduction methods
2. Provide each team with starter research materials (articles, reputable websites)
3. Give teams clear expectations for their presentations:
   - How the process works
   - Pros and cons
   - Who it works best for
   - Potential long-term impacts
   - Reputable resources and organizations
4. Circulate to assist teams with focusing their research and preparing presentations

**Research guidance:**
- Direct students to specific sections of reputable resources
- Encourage critical evaluation of sources (especially important with debt settlement companies)
- Provide a template for organizing research findings
- Suggest looking for case studies or real-world examples

### Presentations (15 minutes)

Teams present their findings on bankruptcy alternatives to the class.

**Facilitation approach:**
1. Allow each team 3-4 minutes to present their alternative
2. After all presentations, present the Rodriguez family case study from the student content
3. Have each group explain how their alternative might apply to the Rodriguez family
4. Facilitate a brief discussion comparing the approaches
5. Have students vote on which approach they think would be most appropriate for the Rodriguez family

**Discussion prompts:**
- "Which alternative seems to have the fewest long-term negative consequences?"
- "Which alternative would provide the quickest relief for the family?"
- "What combinations of approaches might work well together?"
- "What factors about the Rodriguez family situation most influenced your recommendation?"

### Activity 4: Credit Rebuilding Simulation (10 minutes)

Introduce the credit rebuilding simulation that students will work through.

**Facilitation approach:**
1. Explain the simulation structure: starting credit score, rounds representing time periods, decision points
2. Demonstrate the first round with a sample scenario and decision
3. Show how choices impact credit scores and other financial metrics
4. Explain the journaling component and its importance for reflection
5. Set expectations for the completion of the simulation (can be done in class or as homework)

**Key points to emphasize:**
- The time required to rebuild credit after financial setbacks
- The compounding effect of consistent positive financial behaviors
- How different types of decisions impact credit scores differently
- The balance between credit building and overall financial health

### Portfolio Project: Comprehensive Debt Management Guide (10 minutes)

Outline the expectations for the comprehensive debt management guide portfolio project.

**Facilitation approach:**

2. Walk through each component of the guide:
   - Introduction on high debt impacts
   - Comparison chart of debt management strategies
   - Decision flowchart
   - Step-by-step implementation instructions
   - Resources and organizations
   - Credit rebuilding strategies
3. Show examples of well-designed guides (if available)
4. Discuss timeline and expectations for completion
5. Answer any questions about the project requirements

**Guidance for success:**
- Emphasize the importance of organization and visual presentation
- Suggest methods for creating effective comparison charts and flowcharts
- Discuss criteria for selecting case studies that demonstrate different approaches
- Review expectations for citing sources and conducting research

### Reflection (5 minutes)

Guide students through the reflection questions and facilitate a brief discussion.

**Facilitation approach:**
1. Have students independently answer the reflection questions
2. After a few minutes of writing, invite volunteers to share their responses to one of the questions
3. Highlight thoughtful responses that demonstrate deep understanding
4. Connect student reflections to key concepts from both days of instruction

**Discussion prompts:**
- "What surprised you most about what you learned regarding debt management strategies?"
- "How might you apply what you've learned to help friends or family in the future?"
- "Which debt management strategy do you think is most commonly misunderstood, and why?"
