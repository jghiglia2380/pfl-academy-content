# Understanding the Risks of Gambling Learning Lab

## Overview

Welcome to the Gambling Risk Learning Lab! Today, you'll apply what you've learned about probability, expected value, and the house edge through hands-on activities. You'll calculate odds for various gambling scenarios, explore how the house advantage works in practice, analyze decision-making under uncertainty, and develop strategies for responsible gambling. These practical exercises will help you understand the mathematical realities behind gambling and make more informed decisions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this learning lab, you will be able to:
- Calculate odds and expected value in various gambling scenarios
- Demonstrate how the house edge ensures long-term profits for gambling operators
- Analyze the psychology of gambling decisions and common fallacies
- Evaluate the financial impact of different gambling activities
- Develop criteria for responsible gambling practices

## Warm-Up: Probability Challenge

Let's begin by testing your understanding of probability with a quick challenge. For each scenario, calculate the probability of the given outcome.

1. You roll two six-sided dice. What is the probability of rolling a sum of 7?

2. You're dealt 5 cards from a standard 52-card deck. What is the probability of getting at least one ace?

3. In roulette, there are 38 spaces (1-36, 0, and 00). What is the probability of the ball landing on a red number? (There are 18 red numbers.)

4. You flip a coin 5 times. What is the probability of getting exactly 3 heads?

5. You buy a lottery ticket where you need to match 6 numbers out of 49 possibilities. What is the probability of winning the jackpot?

**Discussion Questions**:
- Which probability was most surprising to you and why?
- How do these probabilities compare to everyday risks we take?
- Which gambling game seems to offer the best odds based on these calculations?

## Activity 1: Expected Value Casino

In this activity, you'll explore expected value by creating and analyzing simple casino games, determining their house edge, and observing how probability works in practice.

### Instructions:

1. Form small groups (3-4 students)
2. Each group will create a simple gambling game with clear rules and payouts
3. Calculate the expected value and house edge for your game
4. Play your game for several rounds, tracking results
5. Compare the theoretical expected value with actual results
6. Analyze how the house edge affects outcomes over time

### Game Design Requirements:

- Use common items like dice, cards, or coins
- Create clear rules that are easy to understand
- Establish specific payouts for different outcomes
- Include a mathematical advantage for the "house" (the dealer)
- Design a tracking system to record results

### Analysis Questions:

After playing your game for at least 20 rounds:

1. What was the theoretical expected value for the player per round?
2. What was the actual average result per round?
3. How did the results vary over time? Did players ever come out ahead?
4. If this game continued for 1,000 rounds, what would you expect to happen?
5. How does this activity demonstrate the concept of house edge?
6. What did you observe about short-term results versus the long-term expectation?

## Activity 2: The Gambler's Ruin Simulation

In this activity, you'll explore a concept called "Gambler's Ruin," which demonstrates why a gambler with finite resources playing against an opponent with infinite resources (like a casino) will eventually lose everything, even in a seemingly fair game.

### Instructions:

1. Work with a partner â€“ one person will be the "Gambler" and the other will be the "Casino"
2. The Gambler starts with $100 in chips
3. The Casino has unlimited chips
4. For each round, flip a coin:
   - If heads, the Casino pays the Gambler $1
   - If tails, the Gambler pays the Casino $1
5. Continue playing until either:
   - The Gambler loses all their money (Gambler's Ruin)
   - The Gambler doubles their money to $200 (quit while ahead)
   - 200 rounds have been played (time limit)
6. Track results on the provided worksheet

### Tracking Worksheet:

| Round | Coin Result | Gambler's Balance | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| 0 | -- | $100 | Starting balance |
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| ... |  |  |  |
| Final |  |  |  |

### Analysis Questions:

1. What was the outcome of your simulation? Did the Gambler achieve their goal or go broke?
2. If we consider this a "fair game" (50% chance of winning each flip), why doesn't the Gambler maintain their $100 indefinitely?
3. What would happen if the game were slightly unfair, with the Gambler having a 49% chance of winning each flip?
4. How does this simulation relate to real-world gambling situations?
5. What does this activity reveal about the importance of having a stopping strategy when gambling?

## Activity 3: Gambling Decision Analysis

In this activity, you'll analyze different gambling scenarios and evaluate the financial and psychological factors that influence decision-making.

### Instructions:

1. Review each gambling scenario
2. Calculate the mathematical expectation (expected value)
3. Identify emotional or psychological factors that might influence decisions
4. Determine what a financially rational decision would be
5. Discuss factors that might lead someone to make an irrational decision

- Mathematical expectation of buying 4 more tickets: ______
- Emotional factors that might influence Alex's decision: ______
- Financially rational decision: ______

### Scenario 3: The Poker Tournament

Carlos is considering entering a poker tournament with a $200 entry fee. There will be 100 participants and the prize pool is $18,000 (90% of entry fees). Carlos believes he is better than average but estimates he has about a 2% chance of winning first place ($8,000), a 3% chance of finishing 2nd-5th (average prize $2,000), and a 5% chance of finishing 6th-10th (average prize $400).

- Mathematical expectation of entering the tournament: ______

- Why might Carlos make an irrational decision?: ______

### Scenario 4: The Casino Loyalty Program

Jasmine is a member of a casino loyalty program that gives her $50 in free play each month if she gambles at least $500 during the previous month. She typically plays slot machines with a 5% house edge. She's considering gambling $500 this month to qualify for next month's free play.

- Mathematical expectation of this decision: ______

## Summary

Today's learning lab has provided practical experience in calculating gambling probabilities, understanding expected value, analyzing the house edge, and developing responsible gambling guidelines. These mathematical skills help you see beyond the excitement and entertainment value of gambling to understand its financial realities.

Remember that gambling operators design their games to ensure profitability over time through the house edge. While gambling can be entertaining, understanding its mathematical structure helps you make more informed decisions and manage risks appropriately. The principles of probability, expected value, and risk management you've practiced today apply not only to gambling but to many other financial decisions throughout life.
