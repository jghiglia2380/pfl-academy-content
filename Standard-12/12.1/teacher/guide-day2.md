## Learning Lab Plan Breakdown

### Welcome and Warm-Up: Probability Challenge (8 minutes)

- Begin by having students complete the five probability challenge questions individually
- After a few minutes, review the answers as a class:

1. Rolling a sum of 7 with two dice:
   - Favorable outcomes: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) = 6 outcomes
   - Total possible outcomes: 6 × 6 = 36
   - Probability = 6/36 = 1/6 ≈ 16.67%

2. Getting at least one ace in 5 cards:
   - Probability = 1 - P(no aces)
   - P(no aces) = C(48,5)/C(52,5) = 1,712,304/2,598,960 ≈ 0.6588
   - Probability of at least one ace = 1 - 0.6588 ≈ 0.3412 or 34.12%

3. Roulette ball landing on red:
   - Favorable outcomes: 18 red numbers
   - Total possible outcomes: 38 spaces
   - Probability = 18/38 ≈ 0.4737 or 47.37%

4. Getting exactly 3 heads in 5 coin flips:
   - Use binomial probability: nCr(5,3) × (0.5)³ × (0.5)²
   - = 10 × 0.125 × 0.25 = 0.3125 or 31.25%

5. Winning a lottery with 6 numbers out of 49:
   - Probability = 1/C(49,6) = 1/13,983,816 ≈ 0.0000000715 or about 1 in 14 million

- Facilitate a brief discussion of the questions:
  - Which probability was most surprising and why
  - How these compare to everyday risks
  - Which gambling game offers the best odds

**Teaching Tip**: Have a visual display of the answers prepared in advance, showing the calculations. For the lottery probability, help students grasp the magnitude of the odds by comparing it to other rare events (like being struck by lightning).

### Activity 1: Expected Value Casino (12 minutes)

- Divide the class into small groups of 3-4 students
- Explain the objective: to create a simple gambling game, calculate its expected value and house edge, and observe the effects over multiple rounds of play
- Provide each group with dice, cards, coins, and tracking sheets
- Review the game design requirements:
  - Use common items (dice, cards, coins)
  - Create clear rules
  - Establish specific payouts
  - Include a house advantage
  - Track results

- Circulate as groups design their games, offering guidance on:
  - Calculating the expected value (ensure each game has a negative EV for players)
  - Creating appropriate tracking systems
  - Testing and refining game mechanics

- After game design (about 5 minutes), have groups play their games for at least 20 rounds, tracking results
- Conclude with groups answering the analysis questions and sharing insights with the class
- Highlight how the actual results compare to theoretical expectations, noting both short-term variance and long-term trends toward the expected value

**Teaching Tip**: Provide examples of simple games to inspire students, such as "Roll a die, pay $1 to play, win $3 for a 6" (EV = -$0.50). Encourage creativity but ensure games have a clear mathematical structure that can be analyzed.

### Activity 2: The Gambler's Ruin Simulation (12 minutes)

- Explain the concept of Gambler's Ruin: Even in a fair game, a player with finite resources playing against an opponent with infinite resources will eventually go broke
- Have students pair up as "Gamblers" and "Casinos"
- Distribute the tracking worksheets and coins
- Review the rules:
  - Gambler starts with $100
  - Casino has unlimited funds
  - Each round: flip a coin
    - Heads: Casino pays Gambler $1
    - Tails: Gambler pays Casino $1
  - Continue until Gambler loses all money, doubles to $200, or 200 rounds are played

- Have pairs begin their simulations, reminding them to track results carefully
- Circulate to ensure proper tracking and answer questions
- After about 8 minutes, or when most pairs have reached an endpoint, stop the activity
- Have students complete the analysis questions
- Facilitate a discussion about the results:
  - How many Gamblers went broke versus reached $200?
  - What was the average number of rounds played?
  - What happens in a fair game over time?
  - How does this relate to real gambling situations?

**Teaching Tip**: Create a class tally board showing how many students ended at each outcome (broke, doubled money, or reached round limit) to visualize the overall distribution of results. This helps demonstrate the concept more clearly across multiple simulations.

### Activity 3: Gambling Decision Analysis (12 minutes)

- Introduce the Gambling Decision Analysis activity, explaining that it examines both mathematical and psychological factors in gambling decisions
- Distribute the scenario handouts
- Review the first scenario as a class to model the analysis process:

**Scenario 1: The Sunk Cost Trap**
- Mathematical expectation: 4 tickets × $5 = $20 cost; Expected return: 4 tickets × 0.25 × $8 = $8
- Overall EV: $8 - $20 = -$12
- Emotional factors: Sunk cost fallacy, desire to break even, frustration
- Rational decision: Don't buy more tickets
- Irrational motivations: Alex may focus on past losses rather than future expectation

- Have students work in pairs to analyze the remaining scenarios:

**Scenario 2: The Big Jackpot**
- EV: (25/292,000,000 × $800,000,000) - $50 ≈ $68.50 - $50 = $18.50 (technically positive, but extremely high variance)
- Emotional factors: Excitement of huge jackpot, lottery publicity, dreams of wealth
- Decision considerations: Extremely unlikely to win despite positive EV

**Scenario 3: The Poker Tournament**
- EV: (0.02 × $8,000) + (0.03 × $2,000) + (0.05 × $400) - $200 = $160 + $60 + $20 - $200 = $40
- Emotional factors: Confidence in skills, enjoyment of competition, social experience
- Decision considerations: Positive EV if skill assessment is accurate

**Scenario 4: The Casino Loyalty Program**
- EV: -$500 × 0.05 (house edge) + $50 (free play) = -$25 + $50 = $25
- Emotional factors: Feeling of getting something "free," sense of status or belonging
- Decision considerations: Technically positive EV, but requires significant gambling volume

- Facilitate a discussion about the scenarios:
  - Common patterns across scenarios
  - Casinos' use of psychological factors
  - Strategies for more rational decisions
  - Entertainment value versus financial expectation

**Teaching Tip**: Use a decision matrix on the board to compare the four scenarios across dimensions like mathematical expectation, psychological factors, and rational decision. This visual comparison helps students see patterns in gambling decision-making.

### Activity 4: Responsible Gambling Guidelines Development (8 minutes)

- Introduce the Responsible Gambling Guidelines activity
- Divide students into groups of 3-4
- Explain the objective: develop comprehensive, mathematically-informed guidelines for responsible gambling
- Review the guideline categories:
  - Setting Financial Boundaries
  - Understanding the Mathematics
  - Psychological Safeguards
  - Decision-Making Framework

- Provide research resources on responsible gambling
- Have groups begin developing their guidelines
- Emphasize the need to incorporate mathematical concepts and create practical, actionable recommendations
- Circulate to provide guidance on:
  - Integrating mathematical principles
  - Creating specific rather than vague guidelines
  - Balancing practicality with effectiveness
  - Designing visually appealing presentations

- As time runs short, have groups focus on completing at least two categories
- Ask each group to share one guideline they developed
- Explain that this activity will continue as part of the homework or next class

**Teaching Tip**: Provide examples of effective guidelines that incorporate mathematical concepts, such as "Set a loss limit based on what you can afford to lose, not on what you hope to win" or "Remember that a game with a 5% house edge means you'll lose about $5 for every $100 wagered over time."

### Portfolio Project Introduction (3 minutes)

- Introduce the Gambling Mathematics Analysis portfolio project
- Review the project requirements:
  - Select a specific gambling activity
  - Research mathematical aspects
  - Analyze psychological elements
  - Evaluate financial implications
  - Create a comprehensive report

- Highlight the four components:
  1. Mathematical Analysis
