# The Costs and Benefits of Gambling Learning Lab

## Overview

Welcome to the Gambling Costs and Benefits Learning Lab! Today, you'll apply what you've learned about gambling through hands-on activities. You'll analyze gambling from economic, psychological, and social perspectives, evaluate the impact of gambling on individuals and communities, and develop strategies for promoting responsible gambling. These practical exercises will help you understand the complex nature of gambling and make informed decisions about this activity.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this learning lab, you will be able to:
- Analyze the economic impact of gambling on communities using data and case studies
- Evaluate the psychological aspects of gambling and their influence on decision-making
- Compare the entertainment value of gambling to other recreational activities
- Develop effective messaging for responsible gambling education
- Apply cost-benefit analysis to gambling policy decisions

## Warm-Up: Entertainment Value Assessment

Let's begin by comparing the entertainment value of different leisure activities, including gambling.

### Instructions:

1. Rate each activity on a scale of 1-10 for:
   - **Enjoyment**: How much fun or pleasure the activity typically provides
   - **Social Value**: How much the activity facilitates social connections
   - **Skill Development**: How much the activity helps develop useful skills
   - **Value for Money**: How much entertainment value per dollar spent
   - **Potential Downside**: Risk of negative consequences (1 = high risk, 10 = low risk)

| Activity | Enjoyment (1-10) | Social Value (1-10) | Skill Development (1-10) | Value for Money (1-10) | Potential Downside (1-10) | Total Score |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| Movie Theater |  |  |  |  |  |  |

- **Near-miss effect**: Interpreting a loss that was close to a win as a sign of imminent success

### Part 3: Risk Factors for Problem Gambling

Research suggests certain factors increase vulnerability to developing gambling problems. For each factor, discuss how it might contribute to problematic gambling:

- **Early big win**: Experiencing a large win when first gambling
