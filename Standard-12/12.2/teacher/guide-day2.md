## Learning Lab Plan Breakdown

### Welcome and Warm-Up: Entertainment Value Assessment (8 minutes)

- Begin by having students complete the entertainment value assessment table
- Guide them to rate seven different leisure activities (including gambling) on a scale of 1-10 for:
  - Enjoyment: Personal pleasure derived
  - Social Value: Contribution to social connections
  - Skill Development: Learning or improving abilities
  - Value for Money: Return on financial investment
  - Potential Downside: Risk of negative consequences (1 = high risk, 10 = low risk)

- After students calculate total scores, facilitate a brief discussion:
  - Which activities scored highest/lowest and why
  - How gambling activities compared to other entertainment forms
  - Factors that most influenced their ratings
  - How these ratings might vary among different individuals

**Teaching Tip**: Emphasize that there's no "correct" ratingâ€”different people value different aspects of entertainment. This helps establish that gambling, like other entertainment choices, has subjective value that varies by individual preference and circumstance.

### Activity 1: Community Impact Analysis (12 minutes)

- Divide the class into small groups (3-4 students)
- Assign each group one of the case studies:
  - Case Study 1: Riverdale Casino Development
  - Case Study 2: State Lottery Expansion
  - Case Study 3: Tribal Casino Development

- Distribute the appropriate case study materials to each group
- Review the activity objectives and analysis questions:
  - Identify economic benefits
  - Identify social costs
  - Analyze distribution of benefits and costs
  - Evaluate whether benefits outweigh costs
  - Suggest policies to maximize benefits while minimizing costs
  - Consider personal support for similar expansion

- Allow groups 7-8 minutes to analyze their case study and prepare their findings
- Have each group briefly present their key findings (1-2 minutes per group)
- Highlight similarities and differences between the three scenarios
- Emphasize the complexity of gambling's impact and the importance of considering multiple stakeholders

**Teaching Tip**: Encourage students to look beyond the raw numbers to consider qualitative impacts and the distribution of costs and benefits across different community segments. Ask probing questions about who benefits most and who bears the greatest costs in each scenario.

### Activity 2: Gambling Psychology Exploration (12 minutes)

- Introduce the exploration of gambling psychology as being crucial to understanding why people gamble and why some develop problems
- Have students work in pairs to complete the three sections:
  - Part 1: Motivations for Gambling
  - Part 2: Cognitive Biases in Gambling
  - Part 3: Risk Factors for Problem Gambling

- For Part 1, guide students to rate and explain eight different motivations for gambling:
  - Financial gain, entertainment/excitement, social interaction, escape, skill mastery, competition, cultural traditions, status/prestige

- For Part 2, have students describe how seven cognitive biases influence gambling decisions:
  - Gambler's fallacy, illusion of control, confirmation bias, availability heuristic, loss aversion, sunk cost fallacy, near-miss effect

- For Part 3, ask students to discuss how eight risk factors contribute to problem gambling:
  - Early big win, accessibility, impulsivity, erroneous beliefs, mental health issues, family history, financial pressure, loneliness/isolation

- After about 8 minutes of pair work, facilitate a brief discussion of the reflection questions:
  - How gambling operators use psychology to encourage gambling
  - Psychological countermeasures for maintaining control
  - Applications to responsible gambling program design
  - Personal observations of cognitive biases

**Teaching Tip**: Connect the psychological concepts to casino and lottery design elements students may have observed, such as near-misses on slot machines, the celebratory sounds when someone wins, or the layout of casino floors. This helps make abstract psychological concepts more concrete and observable.

### Activity 3: Responsible Gambling Campaign Development (12 minutes)

- Organize students into groups of 3-4
- Introduce the responsible gambling campaign development activity
- Explain that each group will develop a campaign targeted at young adults (18-25)
- Review the four components to develop:
  1. Campaign slogan and key messages
  2. Educational content outline
  3. Digital strategy
  4. Implementation plan

- Provide example resources of existing responsible gambling campaigns for reference
- Guide students through the planning process:
  - Identify effective messaging approaches for young adults
  - Consider platforms and media young adults use
  - Balance educational content with engaging presentation
  - Think about measurement of effectiveness

- Allow groups 8-9 minutes to develop their campaign concepts
- Have each group present their campaign highlights (about 1 minute per group)
- Provide constructive feedback on the effectiveness and appropriateness of the campaigns
- Highlight particularly creative or insightful approaches

**Teaching Tip**: Remind students that effective public health messaging often focuses on empowerment rather than scare tactics. The most successful responsible gambling campaigns treat the audience with respect and provide practical tools rather than simply telling people what not to do.

### Activity 4: Gambling Policy Debate (12 minutes)

- Divide the class into four groups, assigning each group one of the debate positions:
  - Pro-expansion
  - Cautious regulation
  - Public health focus
  - Gambling-critical

- Explain the debate structure:
  - Initial position statements (2 minutes per group)
  - Questioning round (each group asks one question of another group)
  - Response to questions (1 minute per response)
  - Closing statements (1 minute per group)

- Distribute position information sheets with key arguments to consider
- Allow 5 minutes for groups to prepare their arguments
- Conduct the debate according to the structure
- After closing statements, have students vote individually on the most convincing position based on evidence and reasoning rather than personal opinion
- Briefly discuss the results and what made certain arguments more compelling than others

- Guide students through the post-debate reflection questions:
  - Most compelling arguments regardless of assigned position
  - How preparing assigned arguments affected personal thinking
  - Values and priorities underlying different positions
  - Community evaluation methods for gambling costs/benefits

**Teaching Tip**: Emphasize that the goal is to understand different perspectives on gambling policy, not to determine a "winner." Encourage students to represent their assigned position faithfully regardless of personal views, as this builds critical thinking skills and empathy for different perspectives.

### Portfolio Project Introduction (6 minutes)

- Introduce the Comprehensive Gambling Impact Assessment portfolio project
- Review the project requirements:
  - Select a specific form of gambling
  - Research multiple dimensions (economic, social, psychological, regulatory, ethical)
  - Conduct cost-benefit analysis
  - Develop policy recommendations
  - Create a professional report and presentation

- Detail the four main components:
  1. Research Summary (3-4 pages)
  2. Impact Analysis (4-5 pages)
  3. Policy Recommendations (2-3 pages)
  4. Visual Components (at least two data visualizations)

- Suggest research resources:
  - Academic journals
  - Government reports
  - Public health research
  - Industry statistics
  - Responsible gambling organizations

- Address any questions about project parameters
- Discuss timeline and submission expectations
- Share examples of effective visualizations if available

**Teaching Tip**: Provide a project planning timeline to help students manage this multi-component assignment. Consider offering check-in points for research progress, draft reviews, or peer feedback opportunities to ensure students stay on track with this complex project.

### Reflection and Wrap-Up (5 minutes)

- Guide students through the final reflection questions:
  - How their understanding of gambling has evolved
  - Surprising aspects of community impacts
  - Evaluation of local gambling policy based on new knowledge
  - Responsibility distribution among stakeholders

- Invite 2-3 students to share one key insight from the learning lab
- Summarize the main concepts from both Day 1 and the Learning Lab:
  - Gambling as an entertainment activity with costs and benefits
  - Complexity of gambling's economic and social impacts
  - Psychological factors influencing gambling behavior
  - Importance of responsible gambling practices
  - Multiple perspectives on gambling policy

- Preview upcoming topics that will build on these concepts, such as other forms of financial risk management

**Teaching Tip**: Create a visual "Key Takeaways" summary that emphasizes the multifaceted nature of gamblingâ€”as entertainment, as an economic activity, as a potential risk, and as a policy issue. This helps students integrate the various perspectives explored throughout the two-day unit.
