## 55-Minute Lesson Plan

### Lesson Preparation (Before Class)

- Prepare digital copies of the W-4 simulation activity
- Create a sample pay stub to display during the lesson
- Set up presentation slides with key terms and the Maria case study
- Ensure access to an online paycheck calculator for demonstration

### Lesson Outline

#### Introduction (5 minutes)

- Quick poll: “Who has received a paycheck?” and “Were you surprised by your take-home pay?”
- Introduce today’s focus: income, taxes, and how deductions affect net pay

  - Voluntary deductions (401k, health insurance, benefits)

#### Case Study Activity: Maria's Paycheck (10 minutes)

- Walk through Maria’s paycheck example
- Students analyze in pairs
- Discussion prompts:
