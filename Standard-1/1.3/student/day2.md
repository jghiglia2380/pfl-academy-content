# 1.3: Income and Taxes — Day 2: Learning Lab

## Welcome to the Learning Lab

Today you’ll apply what you learned about income, deductions, and taxes to real-world scenarios and build strategies to manage your income effectively.

## Review of Key Concepts

- Gross vs. net income  
- Mandatory and voluntary deductions  
- How a W-4 form affects tax withholding  
- Why net income matters for budgeting

## Learning Lab Activities

### 1. Paycheck Analyzer

Review sample paychecks across different job types and income levels. Identify and compare deduction amounts. Adjust inputs like retirement contributions to see how take-home pay changes.

### 2. Tax Withholding Strategy Builder

Use your W-4 simulation from Day 1 to explore how different withholding strategies impact your paycheck. Compare outcomes and choose an approach that aligns with your goals.

### 3. Net Income Budget Challenge

Using net income from provided scenarios, create a realistic monthly budget. Include allocations for essential expenses, savings, and discretionary spending.

### 4. Long-Term Impact Calculator

Explore how small increases in voluntary deductions—like 401(k) contributions—can grow over time and affect future financial health.

## Reflection and Planning

Write a short plan describing:

- How you will estimate and track your net income
