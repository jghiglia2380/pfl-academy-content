# 1.3: Income and Taxes - Day 1

### Introduction

When you start working, understanding the difference between what you earn (gross income) and what you actually take home (net income) is essential for successful financial planning. This lesson explores income, taxes, and various deductions that affect your paycheck.

### Key Terms

- **Gross Income**: The total amount of money earned before any deductions
- **Net Income**: The amount of money you actually receive after all deductions have been subtracted
- **Mandatory Deductions**: Required deductions taken from your paycheck, including federal and state income taxes, Social Security, and Medicare
- **Voluntary Deductions**: Optional deductions such as retirement contributions, health insurance premiums, and other benefits
- **FICA**: Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax, which funds Social Security and Medicare
- **W-4 Form**: A tax form completed when starting a new job that determines how much tax is withheld from your paycheck

### From Gross to Net: Understanding Your Paycheck

When you earn money from a job, your employer doesn't simply hand over your full salary or hourly wages. Instead, various deductions are taken out before you receive your paycheck. Let's explore what happens between earning money and receiving it.

### Mandatory Deductions

These deductions are required by law:

1. **Federal Income Tax**
    - Based on your income level and information provided on your W-4 form
    - Follows a progressive tax system (higher earners pay a higher percentage)
2. **State Income Tax** (in most states)
    - Varies by state (some states have no income tax)
    - Typically a smaller percentage than federal taxes
3. **FICA Taxes**
    - Social Security (6.2% of income up to a certain limit)
    - Medicare (1.45% of all income)
    - These fund retirement and healthcare programs you'll benefit from later

### Voluntary Deductions

These deductions are optional but often beneficial:

1. **Retirement Contributions**
    - 401(k), 403(b), or other employer-sponsored retirement plans
    - May be matched by employers (essentially free money)
    - Reduces current taxable income
2. **Health Insurance Premiums**
    - Medical, dental, and vision insurance costs
    - Often shared between employee and employer
3. **Other Benefits**
    - Life insurance
    - Disability insurance
    - Flexible spending accounts (FSAs)
    - Health savings accounts (HSAs)

### Case Study: Maria's Paycheck

Maria earns a gross salary of $3,500 per month. Let's see how deductions impact her take-home pay:

**Gross Monthly Income**: $3,500

**Mandatory Deductions**:

- Federal Income Tax (15%): $525
- State Income Tax (4%): $140
- Social Security (6.2%): $217
- Medicare (1.45%): $50.75

**Voluntary Deductions**:

- Health Insurance: $180
- 401(k) Contribution (5%): $175

**Total Deductions**: $1,287.75

**Net Monthly Income**: $2,212.25

As you can see, Maria's actual take-home pay is significantly less than her gross income. This is why understanding net income is crucial for budgeting and financial planning.

### The Importance of W-4 Forms

When you start a new job, you'll complete a W-4 form that helps your employer determine how much federal income tax to withhold from your paycheck. Properly completing this form is important because:

- **Too little withholding**: You might owe taxes and penalties when filing your tax return
- **Too much withholding**: You'll receive a refund but will have less money throughout the year

Your W-4 should be updated when you experience major life changes such as:

- Getting married or divorced
- Having children
- Taking on a second job
- Experiencing significant income changes

### Reflection Question

Think about your current or future income. How will understanding your net income help you plan for both short-term expenses and long-term savings goals?

### Skill Builder: W-4 Simulation

**Scenario**: Jordan Rivers is a high school student who just got hired for a part-time job at a local coffee shop. Jordan will be working 15 hours per week at $15 per hour. Jordan is single, has no dependents, and this is Jordan's only job. Jordan wants to fill out the W-4 form correctly to ensure appropriate tax withholding.

**Instructions**:

1. Review the W-4 form provided
2. Based on Jordan's situation, complete each section of the form
3. For each step of the form, provide a brief explanation of why you made your choices
4. Consider how different choices might affect Jordan's take-home pay

**Remember**: Your choices on this form will determine how much tax is withheld from each paycheck. Too little withholding means you might owe taxes later; too much means smaller paychecks throughout the year.
