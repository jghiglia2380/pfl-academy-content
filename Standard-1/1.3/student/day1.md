# 1.3: Income and Taxes — Day 1: Instruction

## Introduction

When you start working, understanding the difference between what you earn (gross income) and what you actually take home (net income) is essential for successful financial planning. This lesson explores income, taxes, and various deductions that affect your paycheck.

## Key Concepts

- **Gross Income**: Total earnings before any deductions  
- **Net Income**: Take-home pay after all deductions  
- **Mandatory Deductions**: Legally required deductions like taxes, Social Security, and Medicare  
- **Voluntary Deductions**: Optional deductions such as retirement contributions and health insurance  
- **FICA**: Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax that funds Social Security and Medicare  
- **W-4 Form**: A tax form completed when starting a new job that determines how much tax is withheld from your paycheck

## Deeper Exploration: From Gross to Net

### Mandatory Deductions

These deductions are required by law:

1. **Federal Income Tax** – Based on income and W-4 information; progressive rate  
2. **State Income Tax** – Varies by state; some states have no income tax  
3. **FICA Taxes**
   - Social Security: 6.2% of income (up to a limit)  
   - Medicare: 1.45% of all income

### Voluntary Deductions

These deductions are optional but often beneficial:

1. **Retirement Contributions** – 401(k), 403(b), or similar; often matched by employers  
2. **Health Insurance Premiums** – Shared cost between employer and employee  
3. **Other Benefits** – Life insurance, disability coverage, FSAs, HSAs

## Real-World Example: Maria’s Paycheck

**Gross Monthly Income**: $3,500

**Deductions**:  
- Federal Tax (15%): $525  
- State Tax (4%): $140  
- Social Security: $217  
- Medicare: $50.75  
- Health Insurance: $180  
- 401(k): $175  

**Total Deductions**: $1,287.75  
**Net Income**: $2,212.25

## The Importance of W-4 Forms

The W-4 form helps your employer calculate how much federal income tax to withhold from your paycheck.

- Too little withheld: You may owe taxes at year-end  
- Too much withheld: You’ll get a refund, but smaller paychecks

Update your W-4 when:
- You get married or divorced  
- You have a child  
- You take a second job  
- Your income changes significantly

## Reflection Prompt

How will understanding your net income help you plan for both short-term expenses and long-term savings goals?
