# 1.4: Setting Financial Goals â€” Day 1

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the importance of setting clear financial goals
- Apply the SMART criteria to create effective financial goals
- Differentiate between short-term and long-term financial goals
- Identify methods for prioritizing financial goals

## Introduction: Why Set Financial Goals?

Financial goals give you direction for your money decisions and help you track your progress. Without clear goals, it's easy to spend money without purpose, making it harder to achieve the things that matter most to you.

## Short-Term vs. Long-Term Goals

**Short-term goals** are things you want to accomplish within the next year, such as:

- Saving for a new phone
- Building an emergency fund
- Saving for a concert ticket

**Long-term goals** are achievements that take more than a year to accomplish, such as:

- Saving for college
- Buying a car
- Funding a gap year or travel experience

## The SMART Framework for Setting Goals

To create goals you can actually achieve, use the SMART criteria:

- **Specific**: Clearly define what you want to accomplish
- **Measurable**: Include a specific amount or metric to track progress
- **Achievable**: Be realistic about what you can accomplish given your resources
- **Relevant**: Make sure the goal aligns with your values and priorities
- **Time-bound**: Set a specific deadline for achieving your goal

## Example: SMART Goal in Action

**NOT SMART**: "I want to save money for a laptop."

**SMART Version**: "I will save $800 for a new laptop by saving $100 per month for 8 months, tracking my progress in a savings app."

## Prioritizing Your Financial Goals

When you have multiple goals, prioritization helps you decide where to focus first:

1. **Urgency**: Which goals need to be accomplished sooner?
2. **Importance**: Which goals will have the biggest impact on your life?
3. **Feasibility**: Which goals can you realistically achieve with your current resources?

## Case Studies

**Riley's Approach**  
Riley wants to buy a $800 laptop for college in 8 months. Riley sets up automatic transfers of $100 each month to a savings account and tracks progress using a savings app. By being specific and creating a measurable plan, Riley successfully reaches the goal.

**Morgan's Approach**  
Morgan wants to "save some money for the future." Without specific amounts or deadlines, Morgan doesn't track progress and spends inconsistently. As a result, Morgan hasn't made meaningful progress toward any financial goals.

- What obstacles might you face, and how will you overcome them?
- How will you track your progress and stay motivated?
