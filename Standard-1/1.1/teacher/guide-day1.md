- Check for understanding by asking students to provide their own examples of each concept

### Guided Discussion (15 minutes)
- Divide students into small groups
- Assign each group a different industry or career field (healthcare, technology, skilled trades, education, etc.)

## Skill Builder Activity
The Career Path Plan activity helps students translate concepts into personalized planning.

### Facilitation Notes:
- Emphasize that students should research realistic salary ranges rather than just choosing high-paying careers
- Encourage students to consider multiple pathways rather than focusing on a single option

- For students who are uncertain about career interests, suggest focusing on identifying transferable skills and broader career clusters

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Advanced Students
- Encourage research into more complex career paths with multiple advancement options

- Assign additional analysis of how economic trends might impact career fields
- Have them interview professionals in their field of interest and report findings

### For Struggling Students
- Provide simplified career path templates with fewer variables
- Focus on concrete examples rather than abstract concepts
- Offer more structure in the research process with specific websites and search terms
- Use more visuals to illustrate career progression concepts
- Provide one-on-one coaching during independent work time

### For ELL Students
