# Renting vs. Owning Learning Lab: Practical Housing Decision Strategies

## Overview

Welcome to the Housing Decisions Learning Lab! Today, you'll apply what you learned about renting versus owning through hands-on activities that simulate real-world housing decisions. You'll explore financial calculators, analyze housing scenarios, and develop a personal housing plan based on your unique circumstances and goals.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this learning lab, you will be able to:
- Calculate and compare the total costs of renting versus buying in different scenarios
- Evaluate housing options using multiple financial and lifestyle criteria
- Identify the financial requirements for both renting and buying a home
- Create a personalized housing plan that aligns with your financial situation and goals
- Apply critical thinking to complex housing decisions with multiple variables

## Warm-Up: Housing Priorities Reflection

Take a few minutes to review your Skill Builder activity from the previous class, where you identified your top housing priorities and compared different options.

**Discussion Questions:**
- What were your top three housing priorities? Why are these important to you?
- Did you discover any surprising insights about your housing preferences?
- How might your priorities change as you progress through different life stages?

## Activity 1: Housing Costs Calculator

In this activity, you'll use an interactive calculator to compare the true costs of renting versus buying in various scenarios.

### Instructions:

1. Access the Housing Costs Calculator tool
2. Enter the following information for the rental scenario:
   - Monthly rent: $1,200
   - Expected annual rent increase: 3%
   - Renter's insurance: $15/month
   - Utilities not included in rent: $150/month

3. Enter the following information for the buying scenario:
   - Home purchase price: $250,000
   - Down payment percentage: 10%
   - Mortgage interest rate: 4.5%
   - Loan term: 30 years
   - Property tax rate: 1.2% annually
   - Homeowner's insurance: $100/month
   - HOA fees: $100/month
   - Expected maintenance costs: 1% of home value annually
   - Expected home appreciation rate: 3% annually

4. Review the 5-year and 10-year cost comparisons generated by the calculator

5. Adjust the variables to match your local housing market or personal situation:
   - Try different down payment amounts
   - Change the appreciation rate
   - Adjust maintenance costs
   - Test different rent increase percentages

### Analysis Questions:

- How do the total 5-year costs compare between renting and buying in the original scenario?
- What happens to the comparison when you increase the down payment to 20%?
- At what point (how many years) does buying become more cost-effective than renting in your scenario?
- Which variables seem to have the biggest impact on the overall cost comparison?

## Activity 2: Housing Application Requirements Comparison

In this activity, you'll research and compare the requirements for renting an apartment versus applying for a mortgage.

### Instructions:

1. Divide into small groups of 3-4 students

2. Research the typical requirements for:
   - Renting an apartment
   - Qualifying for a mortgage

3. Complete the comparison chart:

| Requirement | Renting | Buying |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| Credit Score Minimum | | |
| Income Requirements | | |
| Employment History | | |
| Upfront Costs | | |
| Documentation Needed | | |
| Application Process Timeline | | |
| Ongoing Financial Commitments | | |

4. Create a "Financial Preparation Checklist" for someone who wants to:
   - Rent within the next 6 months
   - Buy a home within the next 2 years

5. Present your findings to the class

### Discussion Questions:

- What are the most significant differences in financial requirements between renting and buying?
- Which option has more stringent qualification requirements? Why do you think that is?
- What steps could a person take to improve their ability to qualify for either option?

## Activity 3: Housing Scenario Analysis

In this activity, you'll analyze different life scenarios and determine whether renting or buying would be more advantageous.

### Instructions:

1. Read each scenario carefully

2. Complete the decision matrix for each scenario by rating factors on a scale of 1-5 (1 = strongly favors renting, 3 = neutral, 5 = strongly favors buying)

3. Add up the scores and determine whether renting or buying is the better option for each scenario
