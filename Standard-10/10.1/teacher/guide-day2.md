- Organize students into groups for collaborative activities

## Lesson Plan Breakdown

### Warm-Up: Housing Priorities Reflection (5 minutes)

- Begin by asking students to review their Skill Builder activity from the previous class
- Facilitate a brief discussion using the reflection questions:
  - What were your top three housing priorities? Why are these important to you?
  - Did you discover any surprising insights about your housing preferences?
  - How might your priorities change as you progress through different life stages?
- Connect this reflection to today's learning lab activities

- **Teaching Tip**: Use this discussion to gauge students' current understanding and identify any misconceptions that need to be addressed during the learning lab

### Activity 1: Housing Costs Calculator (15 minutes)

- Introduce the Housing Costs Calculator tool and explain its purpose
- Walk through the basic inputs required for both rental and purchase scenarios
- Demonstrate how to enter the sample data provided in the student materials
- Guide students through interpreting the results, emphasizing:
  - The time horizon's impact on the comparison
  - The effect of different variables on the total cost
  - The importance of considering both financial and non-financial factors

- Have students work individually or in pairs to:
  - Complete the sample scenario
  - Adjust variables to match their local housing market
  - Answer the analysis questions

- Facilitate a brief discussion about key findings from the calculator exercise

- **Teaching Tip**: If technology access is limited, provide pre-calculated comparisons using the sample data and have students focus on analyzing the results rather than inputting data

### Activity 2: Housing Application Requirements Comparison (10 minutes)

- Organize students into small groups of 3-4
- Assign each group to research either rental requirements or mortgage qualification requirements (or provide information sheets if internet access is limited)
- Instruct groups to complete their portion of the comparison chart
- After 5 minutes, have groups pair up to share their findings and complete the full comparison
- Guide students in creating their "Financial Preparation Checklists" for renting and buying

- Facilitate a brief discussion using the provided discussion questions:
  - What are the most significant differences in requirements between renting and buying?
  - Which option has more stringent qualification requirements? Why?
  - What steps could a person take to improve their qualification chances?

- **Teaching Tip**: Consider inviting a real estate professional or mortgage banker to provide insights about local application requirements or providing sample application forms for students to review

### Activity 3: Housing Scenario Analysis (10 minutes)

- Review the three scenarios provided in the student materials
- Explain how to complete the decision matrix using the 1-5 rating scale
- Model the analysis process with a sample scenario not included in the student materials
- Have students work in small groups to analyze the scenarios and complete the decision matrices
- Circulate to provide guidance and ask probing questions

- After groups have completed their analyses, lead a discussion using the provided questions:
  - How did life stage impact the housing recommendation for each scenario?
  - What factors seemed most important in determining the best option?
  - Were there any scenarios where the decision was particularly close or difficult?

- **Teaching Tip**: Emphasize that there are multiple valid approaches to analyzing these scenariosâ€”the process of thoughtful consideration is more important than arriving at a specific "correct" answer

### Activity 4: Personal Housing Plan Development (10 minutes)

- Introduce the Personal Housing Plan activity
- Review each section of the plan (current profile, goals, action steps, challenges/solutions)
- Provide guidance on setting realistic housing goals based on current circumstances
- Allow students to work independently on their personal housing plans
- Circulate to provide individual feedback and encouragement

- **Teaching Tip**: For students who may feel uncomfortable sharing their personal financial information, offer the option to create a plan for a fictional person with circumstances similar to their own

### Introduction to Portfolio Project and Conclusion (5 minutes)

- Briefly introduce the Housing Market Analysis portfolio project
- Explain expectations and timeline for completion
- Address any questions about the project requirements

- Guide students through the final reflection questions:
  - What was the most surprising insight you gained from today's activities?
  - How has your thinking about renting versus buying evolved?
  - What specific actions will you take to prepare for future housing decisions?
  - What additional questions do you still have about housing?

- Summarize key takeaways from the learning lab

## Assessment Opportunities

- **Process Assessment**: Observe student engagement and collaboration during activities
- **Product Assessment**: Review completed housing plans and scenario analyses
- **Reflective Assessment**: Evaluate quality and depth of student reflections
- **Portfolio Assessment**: Assess the housing market analysis project (future)

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Struggling Learners
- Provide partially completed worksheets with sample responses
- Partner students for more complex calculation activities
- Offer additional guidance for navigating the Housing Costs Calculator
- Focus on fewer variables in the scenario analyses
- Provide a simplified housing plan template

### For Advanced Learners
- Challenge students to consider additional variables in their analyses
- Suggest they research more complex aspects like tax implications, investment alternatives, or market trends
- Have them create more detailed and long-term housing plans
- Encourage them to develop more sophisticated financial models for their portfolio projects

### For English Language Learners
- Provide visual representations of key concepts
- Define technical terminology clearly on worksheets
- Allow for discussion in home language during group work
- Provide sentence frames for written reflections

## Potential Challenges and Solutions

### Technology Issues
- **Challenge**: Problems accessing or using the Housing Costs Calculator
- **Solution**: Have backup paper worksheets with pre-calculated examples ready

### Varying Financial Literacy Levels
- **Challenge**: Students may have widely different backgrounds in financial concepts
- **Solution**: Provide additional resources for those needing support; offer extension opportunities for advanced students

### Sensitivity Around Personal Finances
- **Challenge**: Some students may be uncomfortable discussing their family's housing situation
- **Solution**: Emphasize that all activities can be completed using hypothetical scenarios; be mindful of language that assumes certain living arrangements

### Time Management
- **Challenge**: Activities may take longer than anticipated
- **Solution**: Prioritize activities based on your students' needs; be prepared to assign unfinished work as homework

## Extension Ideas

- **Local Expert Interview**: Arrange for students to interview real estate professionals, mortgage lenders, or housing counselors
- **Market Trend Analysis**: Have students research historical trends in your local housing market
- **Housing Policy Research**: Assign research on housing policies and programs that affect affordability
- **Housing Fairness Investigation**: Explore issues related to housing discrimination and fair housing laws
- **Financial Technology Exploration**: Investigate apps and tools that help with housing decisions

## Follow-Up Activities

- Have students present their housing market analyses to the class
- Create a bulletin board displaying housing costs in different areas
- Organize a housing fair with local professionals
- Connect housing lessons to other financial literacy topics like credit, savings, and debt management
