# Understanding the Costs and Responsibilities of Renting Learning Lab

## Overview

Welcome to the Renting Costs and Responsibilities Learning Lab! Today, you'll apply what you learned about rental properties through hands-on activities that will prepare you for real-world renting scenarios. You'll analyze lease agreements, calculate the true costs of renting, practice handling common tenant issues, and develop a personalized rental readiness plan.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this learning lab, you will be able to:
- Analyze a lease agreement and identify key terms, potential issues, and negotiation points
- Calculate the complete costs of renting including upfront, monthly, and hidden expenses
- Develop strategies for handling common tenant-landlord issues and protecting your rights
- Create a personalized rental readiness plan based on your priorities and financial situation
- Evaluate the trade-offs between different rental options based on multiple factors

## Warm-Up: Rental Priorities Review

Take a few minutes to review your reflection from the previous class where you identified your top three priorities when looking for a place to live.

**Discussion Questions:**
- Did anyone have similar priorities? What were some common themes?
- How might your priorities change as your life circumstances change?
- How do your priorities impact the amount you might need to budget for housing?

## Activity 1: Lease Agreement Analysis

In this activity, you'll analyze a sample lease agreement to identify key terms, potential issues, and negotiation points.

### Instructions:

1. Review the sample lease agreement provided
2. Complete the lease analysis worksheet by identifying:
   - Basic terms (rent amount, lease duration, security deposit, etc.)
   - Tenant responsibilities
   - Landlord responsibilities
   - Potential red flags or concerning clauses
   - Questions you would ask before signing

3. For each concerning clause, suggest an alternative or revised version that would be more tenant-friendly

4. Compare your analysis with a partner or small group to see if they identified different issues

### Discussion Questions:

- What clauses or terms were most concerning to you and why?
- What questions would you ask the landlord before signing this lease?
- What parts of the lease seemed most favorable to the landlord? To the tenant?
- What additional terms or clarifications would you want to add to this lease?

## Activity 2: True Cost of Renting Calculator

In this activity, you'll calculate the complete costs of renting for several scenarios, including upfront, monthly, and hidden expenses.

### Instructions:

1. For each of the three rental scenarios provided, calculate:
   - Total upfront costs needed before moving in
   - Total monthly expenses (including utilities and other recurring costs)
   - Annual cost of renting (monthly expenses Ã— 12 + one-time costs)
   - Estimated moving out costs

2. Determine what percentage of income would go toward housing in each scenario (assuming the recommended 30% maximum)

3. Identify any potential hidden costs or fees not explicitly stated in the scenario

4. Calculate the financial impact of three common renting situations:
   - Breaking the lease early
   - Having a roommate move out
   - Receiving a rent increase at renewal

### Scenario 1: Downtown Studio Apartment

- Monthly rent: $950
- Security deposit: One month's rent
- Application fee: $50
- Utilities included: Water and trash
- Additional utilities: Electricity ($60/month), Internet ($55/month)
- Parking: Street parking only (free)
- Laundry: Coin-operated in building ($30/month)
- Lease term: 12 months with 60-day notice
- Early termination fee: Two months' rent
- Annual rent increase history: 3%

### Scenario 2: Suburban 2-Bedroom with Roommate

- Monthly rent: $1,400 ($700 per person)
- Security deposit: $1,400
- Application fee: $35 per person
- Pet deposit: $300 (non-refundable)

- Additional utilities: Electricity ($90/month), Water ($40/month), Gas ($50/month), Internet ($60/month)
- Parking: One assigned space included, second space $50/month
- Laundry: In-unit
- Lease term: 12 months with 30-day notice
- Early termination fee: Three months' rent
- Annual rent increase history: 2%

### Scenario 3: Campus-Adjacent 3-Bedroom Share

- Monthly rent: $2,100 ($700 per person for 3 people)
- Security deposit: $700 per person
- Application fee: $25 per person
- Utilities included: Internet and trash
- Additional utilities: Electricity ($120/month), Water ($60/month)
- Parking: $75 per space per month
- Laundry: In-unit
- Lease term: 9 months (academic year)
- Summer sublet allowed with landlord approval
- Early termination fee: Responsible for rent until replacement found
- Annual rent increase history: 4%

### Analysis Questions:

- Which scenario has the highest upfront costs? The lowest monthly costs?
- How does having roommates affect the overall affordability?
- Which scenario would be most financially risky if your circumstances changed?
- How much money should someone have saved before moving into each option?

## Activity 3: Tenant Rights and Responsibilities Simulation

In this activity, you'll practice handling common tenant-landlord issues by developing appropriate responses to various scenarios.

### Instructions:

1. For each scenario below, identify:
   - The tenant rights that apply
   - The tenant responsibilities that apply
   - The appropriate action steps to resolve the issue
   - Any documentation or communication needed

2. Draft a sample written communication (email or letter) for one of the scenarios

3. Role-play a conversation between tenant and landlord for another scenario

### Scenario 1: Maintenance Request

Your bathroom sink has been leaking for three days. You've placed a bucket under it to catch the water, but the floor is getting damaged. You reported it to your landlord when it started, but they haven't addressed it yet.

### Scenario 2: Security Deposit Dispute

You moved out of your apartment last month after living there for two years. The landlord is withholding $500 of your $1,000 security deposit for "general cleaning and wear and tear" but hasn't provided an itemized list of damages or costs.

### Scenario 3: Roommate Issues

Your roommate moved out unexpectedly, leaving you responsible for their portion of the rent. Your lease makes all tenants "jointly and severally liable" for the full rent amount.

### Scenario 4: Unexpected Rent Increase

You received notice that your rent will increase by 15% when your lease renews next month. Your lease doesn't mention anything about rent increases, and this amount would make the apartment unaffordable for you.

### Scenario 5: Privacy Concern

You came home yesterday to find that your landlord had entered your apartment without providing notice. They said they needed to check the smoke detectors.

### Discussion Questions:

- Which scenario did you find most challenging to address? Why?
- What resources would you consult if you faced these situations in real life?
- How could some of these issues have been prevented before they occurred?
- How might cultural or language differences impact tenant-landlord communications?

## Activity 4: Rental Readiness Plan

In this activity, you'll create a personalized plan to prepare for your next (or first) rental experience.

### Instructions:

1. Complete the Rental Readiness Assessment:
   - Current savings for rental expenses
   - Monthly income and budget
   - Credit score range (if known)
   - Rental history
   - Personal housing priorities
   - Timeline for next move

2. Create a Financial Preparation Plan:
   - Savings goal for upfront costs
   - Monthly rent budget (30% of income recommended maximum)
   - Additional monthly expenses budget
   - Credit improvement steps (if needed)
   - Income stability considerations

3. Develop a Rental Search Strategy:
   - Ideal neighborhoods/locations
   - Must-have features
   - Nice-to-have features
   - Deal-breakers
   - Research resources
   - Timeline for search process

4. Create a Move-In Preparation Checklist:
   - Documents needed for application
   - Questions to ask before signing
   - Move-in inspection process
   - Essential items to purchase
   - Services to set up (utilities, etc.)

### Reflection Questions:

- What areas of rental readiness do you feel most prepared for?
- What areas will require the most work or preparation?
- How will your plan change based on timeframe (e.g., renting in 3 months vs. 3 years)?
- What additional information or resources would help you feel more prepared?

## Portfolio Project: Rental Property Budget Analysis

For this project, you'll research actual rental properties in your area (or an area where you might live in the future) and develop a comprehensive budget analysis.

### Instructions:

1. Select a specific location and rental property type (studio, 1-bedroom, etc.) to research

2. Find 3 actual rental listings that match your criteria using rental websites or local resources

3. For each property, create a detailed budget including:
   - All upfront costs (application, deposit, first/last month, etc.)
   - All monthly costs (rent, utilities, parking, etc.)
   - Estimated annual costs including potential increases
   - Transportation costs associated with the location
   - Savings required before move-in

4. Analyze how each property aligns with:
   - Your personal housing priorities
   - Your current or expected future income
   - Your lifestyle needs
   - Your long-term financial goals

5. Create a final recommendation for which property represents the best value and fit, with justification

6. Include a 1-2 year financial plan showing:
   - Savings timeline for upfront costs
   - Monthly budget while renting
   - Emergency fund for unexpected housing costs
   - Plan for next steps after lease ends

## Reflection and Application
