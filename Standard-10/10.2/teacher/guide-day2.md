## Lesson Plan Breakdown

### Warm-Up: Rental Priorities Review (5 minutes)

- Ask students to retrieve their reflections from the previous class
- Facilitate a brief discussion using the provided questions:
  - What common priorities emerged across the class?
  - How might priorities change across different life stages?
  - How do priorities impact housing budgets?
- Connect this discussion to today's activities, explaining that priorities guide decisions

- **Teaching Tip**: Create a quick word cloud or tally of student priorities to visualize class trends

### Activity 1: Lease Agreement Analysis (12 minutes)

- Distribute sample lease agreements and analysis worksheets
- Briefly review the key components of a lease (recapping from previous lesson)
- Explain the task: identify basic terms, responsibilities, potential issues, and negotiation points
- Demonstrate how to analyze one clause, pointing out potential concerns
- Allow 7-8 minutes for students to work individually or in pairs
- For the remaining time, facilitate a whole-class discussion about findings:
  - What concerning clauses did students identify?
  - How might these clauses be renegotiated?
  - What additional terms would make the lease more balanced?

- **Teaching Tip**: Choose a lease with at least 3-4 tenant-unfriendly clauses to ensure students can practice identifying issues

### Activity 2: True Cost of Renting Calculator (12 minutes)

  - Annual costs
  - Percentage of income
  - Financial impact of common situations
- Allow students 7-8 minutes to complete calculations for at least one scenario
- Spend the remaining time discussing the analysis questions:
  - Which scenario has the highest upfront/lowest monthly costs?
  - How do roommates affect affordability?
  - Which scenario presents the highest financial risk?
  - How much savings would be needed for each option?

- **Teaching Tip**: For classes with limited math skills, consider working through one complete scenario together before students work independently

### Activity 3: Tenant Rights and Responsibilities Simulation (10 minutes)

- Assign each group one scenario to analyze (or allow them to choose)
- Explain the task: identify applicable rights/responsibilities and develop appropriate responses
- Remind students to consider documentation and communication strategies

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Struggling Learners
- Provide a simplified lease with fewer clauses to analyze

- Allow for discussion in home language during group work
- Provide sentence frames for written reflections

## Potential Challenges and Solutions

### Time Management Challenges
- **Challenge**: Students taking too long on lease analysis
- **Solution**: Set clear time limits and use a timer visible to all students

### Calculation Difficulties
- **Challenge**: Students struggling with rental cost calculations
- **Solution**: Provide a step-by-step example on the board or as a handout

### Limited Rental Experience
- **Challenge**: Students with no rental experience struggling to connect to content
- **Solution**: Use additional real-world examples and frame as preparation for future

### Privacy Concerns
- **Challenge**: Students uncomfortable sharing personal financial information
- **Solution**: Emphasize that activities can use hypothetical situations
