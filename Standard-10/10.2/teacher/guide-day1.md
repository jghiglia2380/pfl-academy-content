## Lesson Plan Breakdown

### Introduction (5 minutes)

- Begin the class by asking students about their living situations or their families' housing arrangements
- Ask: "What are some key differences between renting and owning a home?"
- Survey the class to see how many have lived in rental properties or expect to rent in the future
- Explain that renting is often the first step toward independent living, and understanding the process is essential for financial planning

### Key Lease Agreement Concepts (12 minutes)

- Introduce the concept of a lease as a legal contract with binding obligations
- Walk through the seven key components of a lease agreement:
  1. Names and addresses
  2. Rent details
  3. Security deposit information
  4. Lease duration
  5. Policies and rules
  6. Utilities and services
  7. Entry rights

- Highlight "red flags" in lease agreements that students should watch for
- Show examples of problematic lease clauses and explain why they could be harmful

- **Teaching Tip**: Display a sample lease and point out specific sections as you discuss them. Consider using different colors to highlight different types of clauses (tenant responsibilities, landlord responsibilities, financial terms, etc.)

### True Costs of Renting (10 minutes)

- Explain that renting costs go beyond the monthly rent payment
- Present the three categories of rental costs:
  1. Upfront costs (application fees, security deposits, first/last month's rent, etc.)
  2. Ongoing monthly costs (rent, utilities, renter's insurance, etc.)
  3. Potential hidden costs (late fees, maintenance, annual increases, etc.)

- Have students brainstorm costs they might not have considered
- Present real-world average costs for various rental expenses in your area

- **Teaching Tip**: Create a visual aid showing the breakdown of total first-year costs for a typical rental. Emphasize how upfront costs can be a significant barrier to renting.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Renting (8 minutes)

- Create a T-chart on the board with "Advantages" and "Disadvantages"
- Facilitate a discussion where students contribute ideas to each column
- Ensure key points are covered from both perspectives
- Discuss how personal circumstances influence whether renting is advantageous

- **Teaching Tip**: After collecting student ideas, organize them into categories (financial, lifestyle, flexibility, etc.) to show how renting impacts various aspects of life.

### Tenant Rights and Responsibilities (5 minutes)

- Provide an overview of basic tenant rights:
  - Right to habitable housing
  - Right to privacy
  - Security deposit protections
  - Protection from discrimination
  - Right to repairs
  - Due process for evictions

- Balance with tenant responsibilities:
  - Paying rent on time
  - Maintaining the property
  - Reporting problems promptly
  - Complying with lease terms
  - Respecting neighbors
  - Providing proper notice

- **Teaching Tip**: Emphasize that rights and responsibilities vary by location. Provide resources for students to learn about local tenant laws.

### Real-World Example Analysis (5 minutes)

- Present the case study of "Emma's First Apartment" from the student materials
- Walk through her initial costs and monthly expenses
- Have students calculate what income Emma would need to comfortably afford her apartment (using the 30% guideline)
- Discuss what Emma might have overlooked in her budgeting

- **Teaching Tip**: Ask students to identify which costs surprised them or seemed larger than expected. This helps gauge their current understanding of rental costs.

### Skill Builder: Rental Property Comparison Checklist (15 minutes)

- Introduce the Rental Property Comparison activity
- Explain that students will create a checklist based on personal priorities and use it to compare rental options
- Walk through the comparison table and ensure students understand what information to include
- If time permits, demonstrate a quick comparison with two local rental listings

- As students work, circulate to provide guidance and answer questions
- For students who finish early, encourage them to begin their reflection on housing priorities

- **Teaching Tip**: Remind students that there's no single "right" set of prioritiesâ€”different people value different aspects of housing based on their lifestyle, finances, and future plans.

### Conclusion and Reflection (5 minutes)

- Have 2-3 students share insights from their Skill Builder activity
- Ask students to briefly discuss how their housing priorities might change over the next 5-10 years
- Summarize key takeaways about rental costs, lease agreements, and tenant rights
- Preview the Learning Lab for the next class, explaining that students will get hands-on experience analyzing leases, calculating rental costs, and creating a rental readiness plan

## Assessment Opportunities

- **Informal Assessment**: Monitor participation in discussions and group activities
- **Formative Assessment**: Review responses to the Rental Property Comparison Checklist
- **Comprehension Check**: Ask clarifying questions about lease components and rental costs
- **Reflection Assessment**: Evaluate the depth and practicality of students' housing priority reflections

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Struggling Learners
- Provide a partially completed comparison chart with sample entries
- Create a simplified lease terms glossary with straightforward definitions
- Offer a basic rental cost calculation template with formulas included
- Allow students to work in pairs for the Skill Builder activity

### For Advanced Learners
- Challenge students to research and compare actual rental listings in the local market
- Ask them to analyze more complex lease agreements with less common clauses
- Have them calculate the long-term financial impact of different rental decisions
- Encourage them to research tenant rights cases and present findings

### For English Language Learners
- Provide visual representations of key concepts
- Pre-teach essential vocabulary with examples
- Offer lease agreements in students' native languages when possible
- Allow for discussion in home language before sharing in English

## Common Misconceptions to Address

- **"The security deposit covers my last month's rent."** Clarify that security deposits are specifically for damages, not for rent, though some landlords may apply it to unpaid rent.

- **"Rent is my only monthly housing expense."** Emphasize that utilities, renter's insurance, and other ongoing costs significantly increase the true cost of renting.

- **"Landlords can enter my apartment whenever they want."** Explain that laws typically require proper notice except in emergencies.

- **"I don't need renter's insurance because the landlord has insurance."** Explain that the landlord's insurance only covers the building structure, not tenants' belongings.

- **"Verbal agreements with my landlord are just as good as written ones."** Stress the importance of having all agreements in writing for legal protection.

## Extension Ideas

- **Local Rental Market Analysis**: Have students research and report on rental trends in different neighborhoods.
- **Guest Speaker**: Invite a property manager, tenant rights advocate, or real estate agent to speak to the class.
- **Lease Negotiation Simulation**: Create a role-playing exercise where students practice negotiating lease terms.
- **Renter's Rights Campaign**: Have students create informational materials about tenant rights for fellow students.
- **Virtual Apartment Tours**: Use online resources to virtually tour rentals in different price ranges.

## Homework Ideas

- Have students interview someone who rents about their experiences and lessons learned
- Ask students to find and analyze a real rental listing, calculating all associated costs
- Have students research tenant rights laws specific to your state/locality
- Assign students to create a personal rental readiness timeline with financial goals
