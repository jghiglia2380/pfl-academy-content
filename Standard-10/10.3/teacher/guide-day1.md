## Lesson Plan Breakdown

### Introduction (5 minutes)

- Begin by asking students to share what they know about the home buying process
- Survey the class on who plans to buy a home someday and their timeline (5 years, 10 years, etc.)
- Discuss why understanding the home buying process is valuable even if students don't plan to buy soon
- Preview the main topics to be covered in the lesson

- **Teaching Tip**: Connect to personal experiences by sharing brief stories about home buying journeys – both positive and challenging – to frame the complexity of the decision

### The Home Buying Process (10 minutes)

- Walk through the six key steps of the home buying process:
  1. Financial Preparation
  2. Getting Pre-Approved
  3. House Hunting
  4. Making an Offer
  5. Home Inspection and Appraisal
  6. Closing the Deal

- For each step, highlight:
  - Typical timeline
  - Key decisions to be made
  - Potential challenges
  - Tips for success

- **Teaching Tip**: Use a visual timeline to help students see how the process unfolds and emphasize that preparation often takes much longer than the actual purchasing steps

### Types of Mortgages (10 minutes)

- Introduce the five main types of mortgages:
  - Conventional Loans
  - FHA Loans
  - VA Loans
  - USDA Loans
  - Jumbo Loans

- Create a comparison chart highlighting:
  - Down payment requirements
  - Credit score minimums
  - Debt-to-income ratio requirements
  - Advantages and disadvantages
  - Ideal buyer profiles

- Discuss why certain mortgages might be better suited for different financial situations and life stages

- **Teaching Tip**: Use real-world examples of different buyer profiles to illustrate which mortgage would be most appropriate for each situation

### Mortgage Terms and Components (8 minutes)

- Explain the structure of mortgage payments using the PITI acronym:
  - Principal
  - Interest
  - Taxes
  - Insurance

- Compare and contrast:
  - Fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages
  - 15-year vs. 30-year terms
  - The role of escrow accounts

- Demonstrate how to calculate a basic mortgage payment and show how changes in interest rates or loan terms affect monthly costs

- **Teaching Tip**: Use a mortgage calculator to demonstrate in real-time how changing different variables affects monthly payments and total interest paid

### True Costs of Homeownership (10 minutes)

- Emphasize that the purchase price is just the beginning
- Break down the three categories of costs:
  1. Upfront costs (down payment, closing costs, moving expenses)
  2. Ongoing costs (mortgage, taxes, insurance, maintenance, utilities)
  3. Hidden/unexpected costs (major repairs, HOA assessments, market fluctuations)

- Guide students through a sample calculation of the total first-year cost of purchasing a $250,000 home with a conventional mortgage

- Discuss the 1% rule for maintenance (budgeting approximately 1% of the home's value annually for maintenance)

- **Teaching Tip**: Use pie charts or bar graphs to visually illustrate how much of the total cost of homeownership comes from expenses beyond the mortgage payment

### Benefits and Challenges Discussion (7 minutes)

- Facilitate a balanced discussion of homeownership pros and cons:
  - Create a T-chart on the board listing benefits on one side and challenges on the other
  - Ask students to contribute to both sides of the chart
  - Ensure both financial and lifestyle factors are included

- Guide the discussion to emphasize that homeownership is neither inherently "good" nor "bad" – it's a personal decision that depends on individual circumstances, goals, and values

- **Teaching Tip**: Play devil's advocate if needed to ensure both sides are fully explored, especially if students fixate on only positive or only negative aspects

### Skill Builder: Homeownership Readiness Evaluation (10 minutes)

- Introduce the Homeownership Readiness Evaluation activity
- Explain the scoring system and evaluation criteria
- Walk through a sample evaluation to demonstrate how to assess readiness across different time frames
- Allow students to begin working individually on their own evaluations
- Circulate to provide guidance and answer questions

- **Teaching Tip**: Remind students that lower scores are not "failures" – they simply indicate areas for growth and preparation before homeownership becomes a realistic option

### Conclusion and Reflection (5 minutes)

- Summarize key points from the lesson
- Address common misconceptions about homeownership that arose during the lesson
- Guide students toward the reflection prompt: "How might your housing needs change over the next 10 years?"
- Preview the Learning Lab for the next class, explaining that students will get hands-on experience analyzing mortgage options, calculating costs, and creating personalized home buying plans

## Assessment Opportunities

- **Informal Assessment**: Monitor participation in discussions about mortgage types and homeownership costs
- **Knowledge Check**: Ask clarifying questions about mortgage terminology throughout the lesson
- **Application Assessment**: Review students' Homeownership Readiness Evaluations for accurate self-assessment
- **Reflection Assessment**: Evaluate the depth and practicality of students' housing timeline reflections

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Struggling Learners
- Provide a glossary of mortgage terms with simplified definitions
- Offer a basic mortgage calculation template with formulas included
- Use visual aids that clearly illustrate the home buying process
- Allow for partner work during the Skill Builder activity

### For Advanced Learners
- Challenge students to calculate more complex mortgage scenarios with additional variables
- Ask them to research and present on specialized mortgage products not covered in the lesson
- Have them analyze how different economic conditions might affect mortgage rates and housing markets
- Encourage them to research the historical context of homeownership in different communities

### For English Language Learners
- Provide visual representations of key concepts
- Pre-teach essential vocabulary with examples
- Offer mortgage and housing terms in students' native languages when possible
- Use graphic organizers to illustrate the home buying process

## Common Misconceptions to Address

- **"You need a 20% down payment to buy a home."** Clarify that while 20% down avoids PMI, many loan programs allow for much lower down payments.

- **"Owning a home is always better financially than renting."** Explain that this depends on many factors including how long you plan to stay, market conditions, maintenance costs, etc.

- **"Your monthly mortgage payment is the same as your monthly housing cost."** Emphasize that homeownership includes many additional costs beyond the mortgage.

- **"Buying the most expensive home you qualify for is the best investment."** Discuss the importance of considering all financial goals and living within means.

- **"Real estate always appreciates in value."** Address the reality that home values can fluctuate based on market conditions and location.

## Extension Ideas

- **Local Housing Market Analysis**: Have students research and report on home prices and trends in your local area
- **Mortgage Calculator Comparison**: Have students compare different online mortgage calculators and evaluate which ones provide the most comprehensive information
- **Guest Speaker**: Invite a real estate agent, mortgage lender, or recent first-time homebuyer to speak to the class
- **Historical Home Price Research**: Have students research how home prices in your area have changed over time and identify factors that influenced these changes
- **Virtual Home Tour Evaluation**: Have students virtually tour homes online and evaluate them based on both financial and lifestyle factors

## Homework Ideas

- Ask students to interview family members about their housing journeys and decisions
- Have students find a home listing in their area and calculate the full cost of ownership
- Assign research on current mortgage rates and how they've changed in the past year
- Have students create a personalized 5-year plan for preparing to buy a home
