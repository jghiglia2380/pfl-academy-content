- Review all four activities to ensure familiarity with instructions and expected outcomes
- Create groups in advance for collaborative activities
- Prepare a sample completed portfolio project for reference

## Learning Lab Plan Breakdown

### Welcome and Warm-Up (5 minutes)

- Begin by having students briefly review their reflections from Day 1 about how their housing needs might change over the next 10 years
- Facilitate a quick sharing session with 3-4 volunteers discussing their reflections
- Connect these reflections to today's activities by explaining how the learning lab will give them practical experience in analyzing real homeownership situations
- Preview the four main activities and final portfolio project

**Teaching Tip**: Create a quick visual mind map of different life changes that might affect housing needs (career changes, family growth, geographic moves, etc.) to remind students of the factors discussed in the previous class.

### Activity 1: Mortgage Option Analysis (12 minutes)

- Introduce the mortgage option analysis activity by explaining the importance of matching the right mortgage to a buyer's specific situation
- Review the four homebuyer profiles and their corresponding mortgage options
- Model how to analyze one profile by thinking aloud through the process:
  - Identify key factors in the buyer's profile (income, credit score, savings, debt, goals)
  - Evaluate each mortgage option against those factors
  - Justify a recommendation based on specific reasoning

- Divide students into pairs or small groups to analyze the remaining profiles
- Circulate to provide guidance and prompt deeper analysis 
- Allocate time for 2-3 groups to share their recommendations and reasoning

**Teaching Tip**: Encourage students to consider both short-term affordability and long-term implications when making recommendations. Remind them that the "lowest payment" option isn't always the best choice overall.

### Activity 2: True Cost of Homeownership Calculator (12 minutes)

- Introduce the true cost of homeownership calculator activity, emphasizing the importance of understanding all costs beyond the purchase price
- Walk through the provided property details and comparable rental information
- Demonstrate how to calculate total upfront costs using a sample property:
  - Down payment: 10% of $280,000 = $28,000
  - Closing costs: 3% of $280,000 = $8,400
  - Total upfront: $36,400

- Have students work individually or in pairs to complete the full calculations:
  - Monthly mortgage payments (principal and interest)
  - Monthly escrow for taxes and insurance
  - Total monthly housing payment including HOA fees
  - Annual maintenance costs
  - Five-year projection including repairs
  - Comparison with equivalent rental costs

- Guide students through the "what if" analysis questions to explore how changing variables affects overall costs
- Facilitate a brief discussion on the results, highlighting which costs surprised students most

**Teaching Tip**: Use a visual aid showing the iceberg metaphor for homeownership costs – the mortgage payment is just the visible "tip," while many costs remain hidden "below the surface."

### Activity 3: Property Evaluation Matrix (12 minutes)

- Introduce the property evaluation matrix activity, explaining that homebuying decisions involve both objective financial factors and subjective lifestyle considerations
- Review the Jackson family profile and the three property options
- Guide students through the process of:
  - Assigning weights to the evaluation factors (1-10 based on importance to the buyer)
  - Scoring each property for each factor (1-5)
  - Calculating weighted scores by multiplying weight × score
  - Determining which property scores highest overall

- Have students work in small groups to complete the evaluation matrix
- Encourage discussion about how different values and priorities might lead to different property choices
- Have groups share their recommendations and explain their weighting decisions
- Highlight how different groups might reach different conclusions based on how they prioritized factors

**Teaching Tip**: Remind students that there's rarely a "perfect" property – homebuying typically involves trade-offs and compromise. The goal is to identify which property best meets the most important criteria for a specific buyer.

### Activity 4: Home Buying Timeline and Savings Plan (12 minutes)

- Introduce the home buying timeline and savings plan activity as a personal application of concepts learned
- Guide students through the worksheet sections:
  - Setting realistic target home prices based on estimated future income
  - Calculating down payment needs and closing costs
  - Developing monthly savings targets
  - Creating credit improvement strategies
  - Building a detailed timeline with key milestones
  - Identifying potential challenges and solutions

- Have students work individually on their personal plans
- Encourage realistic assessment of current financial situations and future goals
- Provide guidance on typical timeframes for different preparation activities
- Remind students that this is a living document that should be revisited and adjusted over time

**Teaching Tip**: For students who may not plan to buy a home for many years, emphasize that the skills of creating savings goals, improving credit, and planning for major financial decisions are universally applicable to other financial objectives.

### Portfolio Project Introduction (5 minutes)

- Introduce the Mortgage Analysis Case Study portfolio project
- Walk through project requirements and expectations:
  - Selection of property and buyer profile
  - Research of current mortgage options
  - Comprehensive financial calculations
  - Comparative analysis of options
  - Visual representation of findings
  - Recommendation with justification

- Show a sample completed project to illustrate expectations
- Discuss resources for researching current mortgage rates and terms
- Address any questions about project requirements
- Explain the due date and submission process

**Teaching Tip**: Suggest that students consider using their own potential future situation (if appropriate) or that of a family member for the case study to make the project more personally relevant.

### Reflection and Wrap-Up (5 minutes)

- Guide students through the final reflection questions:
  - What was the most surprising or valuable insight about homeownership?
  - How has their perception of buying a home changed?
  - What aspects do they feel confident about now?
  - What aspects do they still have questions about?

- Have students write brief responses on sticky notes and post them on a shared board
- Identify common themes in the reflections
- Summarize key takeaways from both lessons
- Connect homeownership concepts to broader financial planning principles
- Preview upcoming topics related to housing costs and financial decision-making

**Teaching Tip**: Create a "Parking Lot" for questions that students still have about homeownership. These can be addressed in future lessons or through additional resources.

## Assessment Opportunities
