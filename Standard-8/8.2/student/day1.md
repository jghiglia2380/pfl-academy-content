## Skill Builder: Online vs. In-Store Purchase Analysis

**Objective:** This exercise will help you compare the pros and cons of making purchases online versus in-store. You'll consider factors such as price, convenience, and return policies to help you make informed decisions when shopping.

**Scenario Overview:** Imagine you need to buy a new laptop for school. You have two purchasing options: Either purchase it online at a lower price but wait several days for delivery or buy it in-store at a slightly higher price and have it immediately.

**Steps:**

1. Review the Online vs. In-Store Purchase Analysis table provided in the chart.
2. Compare the factors, including price, delivery time, and return policies, between the online and in-store purchase options.
3. Based on your review, decide which option would be the best choice for you based on your needs.

**Reflection Prompt:** After reviewing the analysis, reflect on the following questions: Which factors were most important in your decision-making process? How would your choice change if you didn't have an immediate need for the product?
