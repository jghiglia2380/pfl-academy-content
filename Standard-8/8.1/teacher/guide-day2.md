# Credit Card Use and Management: Learning Lab Teacher Guide

## Learning Lab Overview

**Duration**: 55 minutes
**Objective**: Students will apply credit card concepts through interactive activities and develop a personal credit card management plan.

## Materials Needed

- Digital access to the Learning Lab activities
- Headphones for podcast review (optional)
- Calculator (or calculator app)

## Learning Lab Flow

### 1. Introduction and Podcast Review (10 minutes)

- Have students listen to the pre-recorded podcast reviewing key concepts from Day 1
- Key podcast topics include:
  - The purpose of credit cards vs. debit cards
  - How interest is calculated and charged
  - The importance of grace periods
  - Strategies for responsible credit card use
- After listening, ask 2-3 students to share one important concept they remember from Day 1

### 2. Credit Card Interest Calculator (15 minutes)

- Demonstrate how to use the interactive interest calculator
- Show an example: $2,000 balance at 18% APR with minimum payments
- Have students complete the following scenarios:
  1. Calculate how long it would take to pay off $1,500 at 15% APR paying $75 monthly
  2. Calculate the total interest paid on a $3,000 balance at 20% APR if paid off in 12 months
  3. Have students create their own scenario based on a purchase they might make
- Discuss results: "What surprised you about these calculations?"

### 3. Credit Card Decision-Making Scenarios (15 minutes)

- Guide students through the scenarios, which include situations like:
  - Deciding whether to apply for a store credit card with a discount offer
  - Managing a situation where they've reached their credit limit
  - Choosing between credit card offers with different features
- Have students work individually or in pairs to determine the best course of action
- After completion, facilitate a class discussion about their choices and reasoning
- Emphasize that there may be multiple appropriate responses depending on individual financial situations

### 4. My Credit Card Management Plan (10 minutes)

- Instruct students to create their personal credit card management plan
- Explain that this plan should incorporate what they've learned from both days
- The plan should include:
  - Their criteria for selecting a credit card
  - How they would track spending and stay within budget
  - Their strategy for paying the balance
  - How they would avoid common credit card pitfalls
- If applicable, remind students that responses from their Day 1 reflection will be available for reference

### 5. Conclusion and Reflection (5 minutes)

- Have 2-3 volunteers share highlights from their credit card management plans
- Lead a final discussion: "What's the most important thing you learned about credit cards over these two days?"
- Ask students to complete a quick exit ticket: "Name one way this lesson might change how you use credit cards in the future."

## Differentiation Strategies

- **Advanced learners**: Challenge them to add more complex scenarios to their credit card management plans, such as how to handle financial emergencies
- **Struggling learners**: Provide a template for the credit card management plan with guided prompts
- **ESL students**: Allow them to work with partners during the decision-making scenarios

## Assessment Strategies

- Review student work on the interest calculator for mathematical accuracy
- Evaluate their decision-making process in the scenarios
- Assess the comprehensiveness and practicality of their credit card management plans
