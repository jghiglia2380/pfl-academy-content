# 5.3: Evaluating Saving and Investment Strategies - Teacher Guide

## Day 1: Evaluating Saving and Investment Strategies

### Lesson Overview (55 minutes)

This lesson guides students through various saving and investment strategies, comparing their risk levels, potential returns, and suitability for different financial goals. Students will understand the balance between risk and reward and how to choose strategies that align with their own financial objectives.

### Learning Objectives

- Students will compare the risks and returns of various saving and investment options
- Students will evaluate which financial strategies align with different time horizons and goals
- Students will apply decision-making criteria to select appropriate saving and investment vehicles

### Materials Needed

- Digital access to the Skill Builder worksheet
- Projector for displaying charts and examples
- Optional: Risk-Return visual spectrum handout

### Lesson Plan

### 1. Introduction (7 minutes)

- Begin by discussing the difference between saving and investing. Emphasize that saving is typically for short-term goals and involves low-risk options, while investing is aimed at long-term growth and involves higher risks.
- Ask students to share any experiences they've had with saving or investing (e.g., saving for a new phone, hearing about stock market news).
- Use a quick poll: "What would you do with $1,000 right now?" to gauge students' initial thoughts on money management.

### 2. Saving vs. Investing (8 minutes)

- Present the comparison between saving and investing using the chart in the student materials.
- Emphasize the key differences: risk level, liquidity, return potential, and time horizons.
- Check for understanding by asking: "If you needed money in 6 months for a trip, would saving or investing be more appropriate? What about if you're planning for retirement in 50 years?"

### 3. Common Saving and Investment Options (15 minutes)

- Walk through each saving and investment option described in the student materials.
- For each option, emphasize:
    - The risk level
    - The potential return
    - The liquidity
    - Appropriate time horizon
    - Best use cases
- Use visual aids to show the risk-return spectrum, placing each option appropriately.
- Interactive element: For each investment type, ask students to signal with thumbs up/down if they think it would be appropriate for a specific goal (e.g., "Would stocks be good for saving for next year's spring break trip?")

### 4. Risk-Return Relationship (10 minutes)

- Explain the fundamental relationship between risk and return.
- Use the risk-return categories to organize investment options visually.
- Discuss the concept of risk tolerance and how personal factors (age, financial situation, goals) affect it.
- Mini-activity: Have students privately rate their own risk tolerance on a scale of 1-10, then discuss factors that might influence their rating.

### 5. Real-World Examples (5 minutes)

- Walk through Liam and Julia's examples, highlighting how different strategies align with different goals.
- Emphasize the power of compound growth in Julia's example.
- Optional extension: Show a compound interest calculator to illustrate the dramatic difference time makes.

### 6. Skill Builder Activity (10 minutes)

- Introduce the Understanding Risk and Return activity.
- Guide students through the instructions and expectations.
- Circulate and assist as students complete the chart.
- Facilitate a brief discussion about their rankings of investment options.

### 7. Wrap-Up and Reflection (5 minutes)

- Summarize key takeaways about the relationship between risk, return, and time horizon.
- Have students complete the reflection question individually.
- Preview the Learning Lab for Day 2, where they'll build their own investment strategy.

### Differentiation Strategies

- **For advanced students:** Challenge them to consider how inflation impacts returns and to calculate "real returns" after accounting for inflation.
- **For struggling students:** Focus on the basic distinction between saving and investing, and the most common options in each category.
- **For English language learners:** Provide a visual glossary with key terms and simple definitions.

### Assessment Strategies

- Monitor student engagement during discussions
- Review completed Skill Builder worksheets for understanding
- Evaluate reflection responses for application of concepts
- Listen for appropriate use of financial terminology during class discussions

### Teaching Tips

- Keep the discussion of investment options practical and relatable to teens
- Use real-world examples that connect to student interests when possible
- Emphasize that there is no "one size fits all" approach - appropriate strategies depend on individual goals and circumstances
- Be prepared to address questions about newer investment options like cryptocurrency with balanced information about their extremely high risk
