### Learning Objectives

- Students will justify their investment choices based on financial principles

### Materials Needed

- Student responses from Day 1 reflection

### Learning Lab Plan

### 1. Review of Key Concepts (10 minutes)

- Play the pre-recorded podcast review of key saving and investment concepts from Day 1.
- The podcast should cover:
    - The difference between saving and investing
    - Common saving and investment options
    - The relationship between risk and return
    - How time horizon affects investment choices
- After the podcast, ask 2-3 students to share one key takeaway or something that stood out to them.

### 2. Introduction to Goal-Based Investment Strategy Builder (5 minutes)

- Introduce the Goal-Based Investment Strategy Builder activity.
- Explain that students will be creating a personalized investment strategy based on their own goals.
- Emphasize that there are no right or wrong answers as long as their choices align with their goals and risk tolerance.
- Show how their Day 1 reflections will be incorporated into this activity.

### 3. Financial Goal Identification (10 minutes)

- Guide students in identifying their financial goals in three categories:
    - Short-term (within 1-2 years)
    - Medium-term (3-10 years)
    - Long-term (10+ years)
- For each goal, have them estimate:
    - How much money they'll need
    - How important the goal is to them (priority level)
    - How flexible the timeline is

### 4. Risk Tolerance Assessment (5 minutes)

- Have students complete a brief risk tolerance assessment.
- The assessment should ask questions about:
    - How they would react to market fluctuations
    - Their comfort with potential losses
    - Their general approach to financial decision-making
- After completing the assessment, students should identify their risk tolerance profile (conservative, moderate, or aggressive).

### 5. Strategy Development (15 minutes)

- Based on their goals and risk tolerance, students create an investment strategy that allocates appropriate investment vehicles to each goal.
- For each goal, they should specify:
    - Which saving or investment option(s) they would choose
    - Why this option aligns with their goal's time horizon
    - How the risk level matches their overall tolerance
    - Potential returns they might expect

### 6. Analysis and Justification (5 minutes)

- Students analyze their overall strategy to ensure it creates a balanced approach.
- They should justify their choices using concepts from the lesson.
- Prompt students to consider whether their strategy:
    - Appropriately matches risk to time horizons
    - Diversifies across different types of investments
    - Aligns with their personal comfort level with risk

### 7. Portfolio Integration and Final Reflection (5 minutes)

- Students save their investment strategy to their financial portfolio.
- Guide students to complete the final reflection questions:
    - How has your understanding of investment strategies changed?
    - What surprised you most about creating your own investment strategy?
    - How might you apply these concepts as you begin your financial journey?

### Differentiation Strategies

- **For advanced students:** Encourage them to research and include more sophisticated investment options like ETFs or REITs.
- **For struggling students:** Focus on the most basic allocation patterns (e.g., savings for short-term, moderate investments for medium-term, higher risk for long-term).
- **For English language learners:** Provide visual guides showing the relationship between goals and appropriate investment vehicles.

### Assessment Strategies

- Review completed investment strategies for alignment with financial principles
- Evaluate justifications for evidence of critical thinking
- Assess final reflections for depth of understanding
- Monitor student engagement during the lab activities

### Teaching Tips

- Emphasize that this is a learning exercise - students don't need to have their entire financial future planned out
- Remind students that investment strategies evolve over time as goals and circumstances change
- Be prepared to provide individual guidance for students who have unique financial situations or goals
- Connect concepts to students' lives by relating to goals they likely have (education, travel, first home, etc.)
