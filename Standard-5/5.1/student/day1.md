### Class Discussion: Why Save vs. Invest?

Think about these questions:

- What financial goals do you have for the next year? The next five years?
- How would you decide whether to save or invest for these goals?
- What factors might influence your decision?

### Financial Goal Setting

Using the SMART framework, identify one short-term financial goal (achievable within a year) and one long-term financial goal (more than 5 years).

For each goal, explain:

- Specific: What exactly do you want to accomplish?
- Measurable: How will you track your progress?
- Achievable: Is this realistic given your resources?
- Relevant: Why is this goal important to you?
