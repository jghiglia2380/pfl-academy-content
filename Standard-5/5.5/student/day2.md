### Introduction

Welcome to the Risk Management Learning Lab! Today, we'll build on what you learned about monetary risks and risk tolerance by applying these concepts to real-world scenarios. You'll develop a personalized investment strategy, test it against different economic conditions, and create a plan for managing financial risks over time.

### Part 1: Podcast Review (10 minutes)

Listen to the podcast recap of key concepts from our previous lesson on financial risks and risk tolerance.

### Part 2: Investment Strategy Simulator

In this activity, you'll create investment portfolios for three different scenarios and analyze how they might perform under various economic conditions.

**Instructions:**

1. Review your risk tolerance profile from Day 1
2. For each scenario below, create an investment allocation using the simulator
3. Test your allocation under different economic conditions
4. Analyze the results and explain your reasoning

**Scenarios:**

- Short-term goal (1-3 years): Saving for a car or vacation
- Medium-term goal (5-10 years): Saving for a home down payment
- Long-term goal (30+ years): Saving for retirement

For each scenario, consider:

- How does your time horizon affect your risk tolerance?
- Which types of risk (market, financial, inflation, fraud) concern you most for this goal?
- How does your allocation help manage these risks?

### Part 3: Risk Management Plan

Create a personal risk management plan that addresses the following elements:

1. **Current Risk Profile:** Summarize your risk tolerance (from Day 1) and explain whether you think it's appropriate for your current life stage.
2. **Risk Mitigation Strategies:** Identify specific strategies to address each type of risk:
    - Market risk
    - Financial risk
    - Inflation risk
    - Fraud risk
3. **Life Changes:** Describe how your risk tolerance and investment strategy might need to change during these life transitions:
    - Graduating from college
    - Starting a family
    - Approaching retirement
4. **Emergency Preparedness:** Explain how an emergency fund fits into your risk management strategy and how much you should ideally save.

### Part 4: Portfolio Integration

Apply what you've learned to update your financial portfolio:

1. Review your current financial goals from previous chapters
2. Assess whether your risk tolerance aligns with these goals
3. Recommend adjustments to your savings or investment strategy based on your risk profile
4. Create a timeline for reviewing and potentially adjusting your risk management plan

### Conclusion

Reflect on how understanding risk has changed your perspective on saving and investing. How will you apply these concepts to make more informed financial decisions in the future?
