### Introduction

In this lesson, we'll explore the various types of risks involved in saving and investing money. Understanding these risks is essential for making informed financial decisions that align with your goals and comfort level. While it's impossible to eliminate all risks, there are strategies you can use to manage them effectively.

### What is Risk?

In financial terms, risk refers to the possibility that an investment's actual return will differ from what is expected. This can mean losing some or all of the money invested, or simply not earning as much as anticipated.

### Types of Financial Risk

### Market Risk

Market risk is the possibility of experiencing losses due to factors that affect the overall performance of the financial markets. These factors can include:

- Economic recessions or downturns
- Political events or policy changes
- Major global events
- Industry-specific challenges

**Example:** Anna invested $5,000 in a technology company's stock. When a new competitor entered the market and tech stocks generally declined, her investment dropped to $4,200. This illustrates how market-wide factors can affect individual investments.

### Financial Risk

Financial risk relates to a company's ability to manage debt and fulfill its financial obligations. When companies face financial difficulties, investors may lose money.

**Example:** Sam purchased $3,000 in corporate bonds from a promising startup. The company later struggled with cash flow problems and couldn't repay its bondholders. Sam lost a significant portion of his investment, demonstrating the importance of evaluating a company's financial stability.

### Inflation Risk

Inflation risk is the possibility that the value of your money will decrease over time as the cost of goods and services increases. Even if your money is in a "safe" account, inflation can erode its purchasing power.

**Example:** Michael kept $10,000 in a savings account earning 1% interest annually. After 5 years, he had $10,510. However, during that time, inflation averaged 3% per year, meaning the same goods and services that cost $10,000 five years ago now cost $11,593. Despite earning interest, Michael lost purchasing power.

### Fraud Risk

Fraud risk is the danger of losing money due to deceptive practices, scams, or fraudulent investment schemes.

**Example:** Taylor received an email about an investment opportunity promising 20% returns with "no risk." After researching the company, Taylor discovered it wasn't registered with financial regulators and had numerous complaints. By recognizing these red flags, Taylor avoided a potential scam.

### Risk Tolerance

Risk tolerance is your personal comfort level with potential fluctuations in your investments. It's influenced by:

- Your financial goals
- Your time horizon (how long until you need the money)
- Your personal comfort with uncertainty
- Your financial situation

Understanding your risk tolerance helps you choose appropriate savings and investment strategies. Generally, people fall into one of three categories:

1. **Conservative:** Prefer stability and are uncomfortable with significant fluctuations
2. **Moderate:** Can tolerate some ups and downs for the possibility of higher returns
3. **Aggressive:** Comfortable with substantial fluctuations for the potential of maximum returns

### Managing Risk Through Diversification

Diversification means spreading your money across different types of investments to reduce risk. This strategy is based on the principle that different assets respond differently to the same economic events.

**The Power of Diversification:** If all your money is in one investment (like a single company's stock) and that investment performs poorly, you could lose a significant amount. However, if your money is spread across different investments, poor performance in one area might be offset by better performance in another.

### Asset Allocation

Asset allocation involves dividing your investments among different asset categories, such as:

- Stocks (higher risk, higher potential return)
- Bonds (moderate risk, moderate potential return)
- Cash and cash equivalents (lower risk, lower potential return)

Your ideal asset allocation depends on your:

- Risk tolerance
- Time horizon
- Financial goals

### Reflection Prompt

Why is it important to consider different types of risk when planning your savings and investments, and how can diversification help protect your money?

### Skill Builder: Understanding Your Risk Tolerance

**Objective:** Discover your personal risk tolerance level and identify appropriate saving and investment strategies that match your comfort with risk.

**Instructions:**

1. Take the Risk Tolerance Quiz using the provided link.
2. Your results will categorize you into one of three risk profiles: Conservative, Moderate, or Aggressive.
3. The quiz will ask questions about your comfort with market fluctuations, long-term vs. short-term goals, and your reaction to potential financial losses or gains.

**Reflect on Your Results:**
Based on your quiz results, answer the following prompt:
"After completing the quiz, describe your risk tolerance level (Conservative, Moderate, or Aggressive). Which investment options do you think are best suited for your level, and why? Consider the types of risks discussed in the lesson and how they align with your financial goals."

**Matching Investments to Risk Profiles:**
Refer to the Investment Risk Levels Chart to see which investment options typically align with different risk tolerance levels.
