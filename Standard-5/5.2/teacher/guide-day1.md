# 5.2: Understanding the Power of Compound Interest and the Rule of 72 - TEACHER GUIDE

## DAY 1: 55-MINUTE LESSON PLAN

### Preparation (Before Class)

- Review the lesson content and familiarize yourself with the compound interest examples
- Prepare to show the spreadsheet for the Skill Builder activity
- Consider having a compound interest calculator available (online tool or spreadsheet)

### Introduction (5 minutes)

Begin by asking students if they've ever heard of compound interest or the phrase "making your money work for you." Introduce the concept as one of the most powerful tools in personal finance.

### Key Terms and Concepts (10 minutes)

Present and explain the following key terms:

- Principal
- Simple Interest
- Compound Interest
- Rule of 72
- Liquidity
- Opportunity Cost

**Teaching Tip:** Use simple analogies that students can relate to. For example, compare compound interest to a snowball rolling downhill, getting bigger as it collects more snow.

### Simple vs. Compound Interest Demonstration (10 minutes)

Walk through the example comparing $1,000 growing with simple vs. compound interest over 30 years:

- Simple interest (5%): $2,500
- Compound interest (5%): $4,322

**Visualization Activity:** Draw a graph on the board showing how the two grow differently over time. Point out how the compound interest line curves upward while the simple interest line remains straight.

### The Rule of 72 Exploration (10 minutes)

Introduce the Rule of 72 formula: Years to double = 72 รท Annual interest rate (%)

Work through several examples with different interest rates:

- 3% interest: 72 รท 3 = 24 years to double
- 6% interest: 72 รท 6 = 12 years to double
- 9% interest: 72 รท 9 = 8 years to double

**Teaching Tip:** Ask students to calculate how long it would take to double money at different interest rates to ensure they understand the concept.

### Real-World Examples Discussion (10 minutes)

Present Amanda's and Micah's examples from the lesson content. For Amanda's laptop fund:

- Discuss how at 3% interest, it would take 24 years to double her $600 to $1,200
- Ask students what Amanda should do if she wants her laptop sooner
- Guide them to suggest additional contributions or finding higher interest rates

For Micah's investment lesson:

- Show how $100 grows to $800 after 27 years at 8% interest
- Use this to emphasize the power of starting early

### Skill Builder Activity (10 minutes)

Guide students through the Compound Interest and Rule of 72 worksheet:

1. Review the variables in the chart
2. Help students understand how to read the example showing $500 growing to $8,587.62
3. Have students answer the three questions about total savings, interest growth, and the impact of changing contributions
4. Direct students to complete the Rule of 72 table
5. Have them respond to the reflection question

**Facilitation Tip:** Walk around the room to ensure students are completing the calculations correctly. Be prepared to help with any math questions.

### Reflection and Closing Discussion (5 minutes)

Prompt students to think about a personal savings goal and how they might apply compound interest to reach it faster.

Ask a few volunteers to share their thoughts on why starting to save early is important.

Summarize the key takeaways:

- The earlier you start saving or investing, the more you benefit from compound interest
- Compound interest grows your money much faster than simple interest over long periods
- The Rule of 72 is a valuable tool for estimating how quickly your money can double
