# 5.2: Understanding the Power of Compound Interest and the Rule of 72

## DAY 1: THE POWER OF COMPOUND INTEREST

### Introduction to Compound Interest

Compound interest is often called the "eighth wonder of the world" because it allows your money to grow exponentially over time. Unlike simple interest, which is only calculated on the original principal, compound interest is calculated on both the principal and any interest already earned.

**Key Terms:**

- **Principal**: The initial amount of money deposited or invested
- **Simple Interest**: Interest earned only on the principal
- **Compound Interest**: Interest earned on both the principal and previously earned interest
- **Rule of 72**: A formula that estimates how long it will take for an investment to double at a given interest rate

### Why Compound Interest Matters

When you save or invest money, compound interest can significantly increase your wealth over time. The longer your money compounds, the more dramatic the growth becomes. This is why financial experts always emphasize the importance of starting to save and invest early.

### Simple vs. Compound Interest

Let's compare how $1,000 grows over 30 years with:

- Simple interest at 5%: $1,000 + ($1,000 × 5% × 30) = $2,500
- Compound interest at 5%: $1,000 × (1 + 5%)^30 = $4,322

That's a difference of $1,822 just by letting your interest earn interest!

### The Rule of 72

The Rule of 72 is a simple way to estimate how long it will take for your money to double at a given interest rate:

**Years to double = 72 ÷ Annual interest rate (%)**

For example:

- At 6% interest, your money doubles in approximately 12 years (72 ÷ 6 = 12)
- At 9% interest, your money doubles in approximately 8 years (72 ÷ 9 = 8)

### Real-World Examples

**Example 1: Amanda's Laptop Fund**
Amanda wants to save $1,200 for a new laptop. She has $600 now and puts it in a savings account that earns 3% interest compounded annually.

- Using the Rule of 72: 72 ÷ 3 = 24 years to double her money
- If she wants her laptop sooner, she'll need to either:
    - Find a higher interest rate
    - Make additional contributions to her savings
    - Or both!

**Example 2: Micah's Investment Lesson**
Micah is teaching his younger brother about investing. He explains that if his brother invests $100 with an 8% annual return:

- Using the Rule of 72: 72 ÷ 8 = 9 years to double to $200
- After another 9 years, it would double again to $400
- After a total of 27 years (3 doubling periods), the $100 would be worth $800

### Opportunity Cost and Financial Decisions

Every financial decision involves opportunity cost—what you give up when you choose one option over another.

When you spend $100 on something today, you're not just giving up $100. You're also giving up all the potential future growth that money could have generated through compound interest.

For example, $100 invested at 7% for 40 years would grow to about $1,500. That's the true opportunity cost of spending that $100 today.

### Skill Builder: Understanding Compound Interest and the Rule of 72

In this activity, you will use a provided chart to explore how compound interest works and calculate how long it will take for your investments to double using the Rule of 72. This exercise will help you understand the power of compound interest and how small, regular investments can grow significantly over time.

**Steps to Complete the Activity:**

1. **Review the Variables:**
   a. Initial Investment ($): This is the amount you start with. In the example, it's $500.
   b. Monthly Contribution ($): The amount you will add each month. In this case, $50 per month.
   c. Annual Interest Rate (%): The yearly rate at which your investment grows. We are using 5% in this example.
   d. Time Horizon (Years): The number of years the investment will grow—here, it's set to 10 years.
2. **Complete the Chart:** Use the example values to understand how your investment grows with compound interest. Calculate the total amount your investment will grow to after 10 years. In the example provided, the investment grows to $8,587.62. Fill in your own values if needed and observe the differences.
3. **Answer the Questions:**
   a. What is the total amount you would have saved without investing?
   b. How much did the investment grow based on the interest rate?
   c. How would a change in monthly contributions affect the overall investment?
4. **Apply the Rule of 72:** Complete the table below to find out how long it would take for your investment to double at different interest rates.

| Interest Rate | Calculation | Years to Double |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2% | 72 ÷ 2 = |  |
| 4% | 72 ÷ 4 = |  |
| 6% | 72 ÷ 6 = |  |
| 8% | 72 ÷ 8 = |  |
| 10% | 72 ÷ 10 = |  |
| 12% | 72 ÷ 12 = |  |

5. **Reflection Question:** Based on your calculations, which interest rate would double your savings the fastest? Why might you choose an investment with a lower interest rate in some situations?

### Reflection

Think about a goal you want to save for. How can you use compound interest to reach your goal faster? Why is it important to start saving or investing early?
