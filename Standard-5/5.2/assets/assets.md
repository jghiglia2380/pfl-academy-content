Where:
    - A = final amount
    - P = initial principal
    - r = annual interest rate (decimal)
    - n = number of times interest compounds per year
    - t = time in years
    - PMT = regular payment amount
- All calculators should handle decimal inputs appropriately
- Data should persist between page navigation within the Learning Lab
